"1","Deep Bi-directional Attention Network for Image Super-Resolution Quality Assessment","Yixiao Li, Xiaoyuan Yang, Jun Fu, Guanghui Yue, Wei Zhou","Multimedia (cs.MM)","There has emerged a growing interest in exploring efficient quality assessment algorithms for image super-resolution (SR). However, employing deep learning techniques, especially dual-branch algorithms, to automatically evaluate the visual quality of SR images remains challenging. Existing SR image quality assessment (IQA) metrics based on two-stream networks lack interactions between branches. To address this, we propose a novel full-reference IQA (FR-IQA) method for SR images. Specifically, producing SR images and evaluating how close the SR images are to the corresponding HR references are separate processes. Based on this consideration, we construct a deep Bi-directional Attention Network (BiAtten-Net) that dynamically deepens visual attention to distortions in both processes, which aligns well with the human visual system (HVS). Experiments on public SR quality databases demonstrate the superiority of our proposed BiAtten-Net over state-of-the-art quality assessment methods. In addition, the visualization results and ablation study show the effectiveness of bi-directional attention.","Fri, 15 Mar 2024 15:38:30 UTC (2,855 KB)"
"2","Action Functional as Early Warning Indicator in the Space of Probability Measures","Peng Zhang, Ting Gao, Jin Guo, Jinqiao Duan","Dynamical Systems (math.DS)","In neuroscience, scientists have some hypotheses on the brain's critical dynamics, which means the brain may stay in a phase transition state between ordered and disordered activities. Some tipping points, as a past of no return, can be critical for neural diseases. Therefore, a key question is how the critical brain hypothesis relates to pathological conditions compared with normal brain functionality. Action functional between two meta-stable states in stochastic dynamical systems is a good tool to study the critical transition and tipping. Here we extend the conventional Onsager-Machlup action functional of finding the most probable transition pathway to be looking for the evolutionary transition dynamics between two meta-stable invariant sets. Hence a rich theory from Schrödinger Bridge and Optimal Transport is brought in to solve this problem. Furthermore, different from various early warning indicators via statistics, bifurcation theory, information theory, statistical physics, topology, graph theory, we propose a novel viewpoint of early warning indicators in the space of probability measure, which facilitates us to build indicators based on action functional. To validate our framework, we apply this methodology to a Morris-Lecar model introduced to analyze the transition dynamics between a meta-stable state and the homo-clinic orbit. Besides, the real Alzheimer's data from ADNI database is also investigated to study the early warning signals of transition from healthy to pre-AD states. This framework not only extends the transition path to be pathway measures between two given densities on invariant sets but also shows potential ability for early warning indicators or biomarkers in complex diseases.","Fri, 15 Mar 2024 15:38:15 UTC (3,938 KB)"

Azevedo, Viviane T. da Silva, Renato Cerqueira","Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)","We present a knowledge integration framework (called KIF) that uses Wikidata as a lingua franca to integrate heterogeneous knowledge bases. These can be triplestores, relational databases, CSV files, etc., which may or may not use the Wikidata dialect of RDF. KIF leverages Wikidata's data model and vocabulary plus user-defined mappings to expose a unified view of the integrated bases while keeping track of the context and provenance of their statements. The result is a virtual knowledge base which behaves like an ""extended Wikidata"" and which can be queried either through an efficient filter interface or using SPARQL. We present the design and implementation of KIF, discuss how we have used it to solve a real integration problem in the domain of chemistry (involving Wikidata, PubChem, and IBM CIRCA), and present experimental results on the performance and overhead of KIF.","Fri, 15 Mar 2024 13:46:36 UTC (244 KB)"
"4","H$α$ Time Delays of AGNs from the Zwicky Transcient Facility Broadband Photometry","Qinchun Ma, Yuhan Wen, Xue-Bing Wu, Huapeng Gu, Yuming Fu","Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA)","In our previous work on broadband photometric reverberation mapping (PRM), we proposed the ICCF-Cut process to obtain the time lags of H$\alpha$ emission line from two broadband lightcurves via subtracting the continuum emission from the line band. Extending the work, we enlarge our sample to the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) database. We adopt two criteria to select 123 type 1 AGNs with sufficient variability and smooth lightcurves from 3537 AGNs at $z<0.09$ with more than 100 epoch observations in the $g$ and $r$ bands from the ZTF database. We calculate the H$\alpha$ time lags for 23 of them which have previous spectroscopic reverberation mapping (SRM) results using ICCF-Cut, JAVELIN and $\chi ^2$ methods. Our obtained H$\alpha$ time lags are slightly larger than the H$\beta$ time lags, which is consistent with the previous SRM results and the theoretical model of the AGN broad line region. The comparisons between SRM and PRM lag distributions and between the subtracted emission line lightcurves indicate that after selecting AGNs with the two criteria, combining the ICCF-Cut, JAVELIN and $\chi^2$ methods provides an efficient way to get the reliable H$\alpha$ lags from the broadband PRM. Such techniques can be used to estimate the black hole masses of a large sample of AGNs in the large multi-epoch photometric sky surveys such as the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) and the survey from the Wide Field Survey Telescope (WFST) in the near future.","Fri, 15 Mar 2024 11:42:22 UTC (4,587 KB)"

Unlike existing dense matching based methods that typically struggle with noisy partial scans, we propose to leverage category-consistent sparse keypoints to naturally handle both full and partial object scans. Specifically, we first employ a lightweight retrieval module to establish a keypoint-based embedding space, measuring the similarity among objects by dynamically aggregating deformation-aware local-global features around extracted keypoints. Objects that are close in the embedding space are considered similar in geometry. Then we introduce the neural cage-based deformation module that estimates the influence vector of each keypoint upon cage vertices inside its local support region to control the deformation of the retrieved shape. Extensive experiments on the synthetic dataset PartNet and the real-world dataset Scan2CAD demonstrate that KP-RED surpasses existing state-of-the-art approaches by a large margin.

Moctopus employs a PIM-friendly dynamic graph partitioning algorithm, which tackles graph skewness and preserves graph locality with low overhead for RPQ processing. Moctopus enables efficient graph update by amortizing the host CPU's update overhead to PIM modules. Evaluation of Moctopus demonstrates superiority over the state-of-the-art traditional graph database.","Fri, 15 Mar 2024 06:46:00 UTC (409 KB)"

Nevertheless, they face challenges when dealing with verbose database information and complex user intentions. This paper presents a two-stage framework to enhance the performance of current LLM-based natural language to SQL systems. We first introduce a novel prompt representation, called reference-enhanced representation, which includes schema information and randomly sampled cell values from tables to instruct LLMs in generating SQL queries. Then, in the first stage, question-SQL pairs are retrieved as few-shot demonstrations, prompting the LLM to generate a preliminary SQL (PreSQL). After that, the mentioned entities in PreSQL are parsed to conduct schema linking, which can significantly compact the useful information. In the second stage, with the linked schema, we simplify the prompt's schema information and instruct the LLM to produce the final SQL. Finally, as the post-refinement module, we propose using cross-consistency across different LLMs rather than self-consistency within a particular LLM. Our methods achieve new SOTA results on the Spider benchmark, with an execution accuracy of 87.6%.","Wed, 13 Mar 2024 02:32:41 UTC (153 KB)"

Kenny Jones, Qiuhong Anna Wei, Kailiang Fu, Daniel Ritchie","Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV)","We present a system for generating indoor scenes in response to text prompts. The prompts are not limited to a fixed vocabulary of scene descriptions, and the objects in generated scenes are not restricted to a fixed set of object categories -- we call this setting indoor scene generation. Unlike most prior work on indoor scene generation, our system does not require a large training dataset of existing 3D scenes. Instead, it leverages the world knowledge encoded in pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to synthesize programs in a domain-specific layout language that describe objects and spatial relations between them. Executing such a program produces a specification of a constraint satisfaction problem, which the system solves using a gradient-based optimization scheme to produce object positions and orientations. To produce object geometry, the system retrieves 3D meshes from a database. Unlike prior work which uses databases of category-annotated, mutually-aligned meshes, we develop a pipeline using vision-language models (VLMs) to retrieve meshes from massive databases of un-annotated, inconsistently-aligned meshes. Experimental evaluations show that our system outperforms generative models trained on 3D data for traditional, closed-universe scene generation tasks; it also outperforms a recent LLM-based layout generation method on open-universe scene generation.","Mon, 5 Feb 2024 01:59:31 UTC (30,736 KB)"
"9","Localization in Digital Twin MIMO Networks: A Case for Massive Fingerprinting","João Morais, Ahmed Alkhateeb","Information Theory (cs.IT)","Localization in outdoor wireless systems typically requires transmitting specific reference signals to estimate distance (trilateration methods) or angle (triangulation methods). These cause overhead on communication, need a LoS link to work well, and require multiple base stations, often imposing synchronization or specific hardware requirements. Fingerprinting has none of these drawbacks, but building its database requires high human effort to collect real-world measurements. For a long time, this issue limited the size of databases and thus their performance. This work proposes significantly reducing human effort in building fingerprinting databases by populating them with \textit{digital twin RF maps}. These RF maps are built from ray-tracing simulations on a digital replica of the environment across several frequency bands and beamforming configurations. Online user fingerprints are then matched against this spatial database. The approach was evaluated with practical simulations using realistic propagation models and user measurements. Our experiments show sub-meter localization errors on a NLoS location 95\% of the time using sensible user measurement report sizes. Results highlight the promising potential of the proposed digital twin approach for ubiquitous wide-area 6G localization.","Thu, 14 Mar 2024 17:52:17 UTC (3,872 KB)"
"10","Iterative Forgetting: Online Data Stream Regression Using Database-Inspired Adaptive Granulation","Niket Kathiriya, Hossein Haeri, Cindy Chen, Kshitij Jerath","Machine Learning (cs.LG)","Many modern systems, such as financial, transportation, and telecommunications systems, are time-sensitive in the sense that they demand low-latency predictions for real-time decision-making. Such systems often have to contend with continuous unbounded data streams as well as concept drift, which are challenging requirements that traditional regression techniques are unable to cater to. There exists a need to create novel data stream regression methods that can handle these scenarios. We present a database-inspired datastream regression model that (a) uses inspiration from R*-trees to create granules from incoming datastreams such that relevant information is retained, (b) iteratively forgets granules whose information is deemed to be outdated, thus maintaining a list of only recent, relevant granules, and (c) uses the recent data and granules to provide low-latency predictions. The R*-tree-inspired approach also makes the algorithm amenable to integration with database systems. Our experiments demonstrate that the ability of this method to discard data produces a significant order-of-magnitude improvement in latency and training time when evaluated against the most accurate state-of-the-art algorithms, while the R*-tree-inspired granulation technique provides competitively accurate predictions","Thu, 14 Mar 2024 17:26:00 UTC (4,292 KB)"

HEX aims to provide a unified reference for high-pressure research, by compiling all available experimental information on elements at high pressure, and complementing it with the results of accurate evolutionary crystal structure prediction runs based on Density Functional Theory. Besides offering a much-needed reference, our work also serves as a benchmark of the accuracy of current ab-initio methods for crystal structure prediction. We find that, in 98 % of the cases in which experimental information is available, ab-initio crystal structure prediction yields structures which either coincide or are degenerate in enthalpy to within 300 K with experimental ones. The main manuscript contains synthetic tables and figures, while the Crystallographic Information File (cif) for all structures will be available on a figshare online repository when the paper will be published.","Thu, 14 Mar 2024 17:22:04 UTC (7,163 KB)"
"12","Algorithmic syntactic causal identification","Dhurim Cakiqi, Max A. Little","Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)","Causal identification in causal Bayes nets (CBNs) is an important tool in causal inference allowing the derivation of interventional distributions from observational distributions where this is possible in principle. However, most existing formulations of causal identification using techniques such as d-separation and do-calculus are expressed within the mathematical language of classical probability theory on CBNs. However, there are many causal settings where probability theory and hence current causal identification techniques are inapplicable such as relational databases, dataflow programs such as hardware description languages, distributed systems and most modern machine learning algorithms. We show that this restriction can be lifted by replacing the use of classical probability theory with the alternative axiomatic foundation of symmetric monoidal categories. In this alternative axiomatization, we show how an unambiguous and clean distinction can be drawn between the general syntax of causal models and any specific semantic implementation of that causal model. This allows a purely syntactic algorithmic description of general causal identification by a translation of recent formulations of the general ID algorithm through fixing. Our description is given entirely in terms of the non-parametric ADMG structure specifying a causal model and the algebraic signature of the corresponding monoidal category, to which a sequence of manipulations is then applied so as to arrive at a modified monoidal category in which the desired, purely syntactic interventional causal model, is obtained. We use this idea to derive purely syntactic analogues of classical back-door and front-door causal adjustment, and illustrate an application to a more complex causal model.","Thu, 14 Mar 2024 17:14:53 UTC (16 KB)"

Recently, NeRF has been employed to enhance pose regression and scene coordinate regression models by augmenting the training database, providing auxiliary supervision through rendered images, or serving as an iterative refinement module. We extend its recognized advantages -- its ability to provide a compact scene representation with realistic appearances and accurate geometry -- by exploring the potential of NeRF's internal features in establishing precise 2D-3D matches for localization. To this end, we conduct a comprehensive examination of NeRF's implicit knowledge, acquired through view synthesis, for matching under various conditions. This includes exploring different matching network architectures, extracting encoder features at multiple layers, and varying training configurations. Significantly, we introduce NeRFMatch, an advanced 2D-3D matching function that capitalizes on the internal knowledge of NeRF learned via view synthesis. Our evaluation of NeRFMatch on standard localization benchmarks, within a structure-based pipeline, sets a new state-of-the-art for localization performance on Cambridge Landmarks.","Thu, 14 Mar 2024 17:11:49 UTC (3,283 KB)"

Intra and cross-dataset evaluations were performed to measure synthetic image generalisation capabilities using a cross-dataset for evaluation. Three different pre-trained networks were used as feature extractors from traditional MobileNetV2, MobileNetV3 and EfficientNetB0. Our results show that MAD trained on EfficientNetB0 from FERET, FRGCv2, and FRLL can reach a lower error rate in comparison with SOTA. Conversely, worse performances were reached when the system was trained only with synthetic images. A mixed approach (synthetic + digital) database may help to improve MAD and reduce the error rate. This fact shows that we still need to keep going with our efforts to include synthetic images in the training process.","Thu, 14 Mar 2024 13:31:56 UTC (12,705 KB)"

We show that our approach, which integrates a medical coding step into the text-to-SQL process, significantly improves the performance over simple prompting. Our findings indicate that although current language models are not yet sufficiently accurate for unsupervised use, RAG offers a promising direction for improving their capabilities, as shown in a realistic industry setting.","Thu, 14 Mar 2024 09:45:05 UTC (468 KB)"

Resources like widely-accepted classification criteria or field taxonomies are unavailable for a domain like artificial intelligence (AI), which spans emerging topics and technologies. We address these challenges by inferring a functional definition of AI research from existing expert labels, and then evaluating state-of-the-art chatbot models on the task of expert data annotation. Using the arXiv publication database as ground-truth, we experiment with prompt engineering for GPT chatbot models to identify an alternative, automated expert annotation pipeline that assigns AI labels with 94% accuracy. For comparison, we fine-tune SPECTER, a transformer language model pre-trained on scientific publications, that achieves 96% accuracy (only 2% higher than GPT) on classifying AI publications. Our results indicate that with effective prompt engineering, chatbots can be used as reliable data annotators even where subject-area expertise is required. To evaluate the utility of chatbot-annotated datasets on downstream classification tasks, we train a new classifier on GPT-labeled data and compare its performance to the arXiv-trained model. The classifier trained on GPT-labeled data outperforms the arXiv-trained model by nine percentage points, achieving 82% accuracy.","Thu, 14 Mar 2024 04:43:02 UTC (270 KB)"

Astronomical photographic observations in China began in 1901, and over a century, a total of approximately 30,000 astronomical photographic plates have been captured. These historical plates play an irreplaceable role in conducting long-term, time-domain astronomical research. To preserve and explore these valuable original astronomical observational data, Shanghai Astronomical Observatory has organized the transportation of plates taken at night from various stations across the country to the Sheshan Plate Archive for centralized preservation. For the first time, plate information statistics was performed. On this basis, the plates were cleaned and digitally scanned, and finally digitized images were acquired for 29,314 plates. In this study, using Gaia DR2 as the reference star catalog, astrometric processing has been carried out successfully on 15,696 single-exposure plates, including object extraction, stellar identification, and plate model computation. As a result, for long focal length telescopes, such as the 40cm double-tube refractor telescope and the 1.56m reflector telescope at the Shanghai Astronomical Observatory and the 1m reflector telescope at the Yunnan Astronomical Observatory, the astrometric accuracy obtained for their plates is approximately 0.1"" to 0.3"". The distribution of astrometric accuracy for medium and short focal length telescopes ranges from 0.3"" to 1.0"".

Within such a formulation, it is challenging to pinpoint why one should cite a specific research paper for a particular query, leading to limited recommendation interpretability. To alleviate this, we introduce the evidence-grounded local citation recommendation task, where the target latent space comprises evidence spans for recommending specific papers. Using a distantly-supervised evidence retrieval and multi-step re-ranking framework, our proposed system, ILCiteR, recommends papers to cite for a query grounded on similar evidence spans extracted from the existing research literature. Unlike past formulations that simply output recommendations, ILCiteR retrieves ranked lists of evidence span and recommended paper pairs. Secondly, previously proposed neural models for citation recommendation require expensive training on massive labeled data, ideally after every significant update to the pool of candidate papers. In contrast, ILCiteR relies solely on distant supervision from a dynamic evidence database and pre-trained Transformer-based Language Models without any model training. We contribute a novel dataset for the evidence-grounded local citation recommendation task and demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed conditional neural rank-ensembling approach for re-ranking evidence spans.","Wed, 13 Mar 2024 17:38:05 UTC (903 KB)"

The parameters of these models are often estimated using inverse probability of treatment weighting. To ensure that the estimated weights adequately control confounding, it is possible to check for residual imbalance between treatment groups in the weighted data. Several balance metrics have been developed and compared in the cross-sectional case but have not yet been evaluated and compared in longitudinal studies with time-varying treatment. We have first extended the definition of several balance metrics to the case of a time-varying treatment, with or without censoring. We then compared the performance of these balance metrics in a simulation study by assessing the strength of the association between their estimated level of imbalance and bias. We found that the Mahalanobis balance performed best.Finally, the method was illustrated for estimating the cumulative effect of statins exposure over one year on the risk of cardiovascular disease or death in people aged 65 and over in population-wide administrative data.

Marshall","Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)","Context. The third Gaia Data Release, which includes BP/RP spectra for 219 million sources, has opened a new window in the exploration of the chemical history and evolution of the Milky Way. The wealth of information encapsulated in these data is far greater than their low resolving power (R=50) at first glance would suggest, as shown in many studies. We zero in on the use of this data for the purpose of the detection of ''new'' metal-poor stars, which are hard to find yet essential for understanding - among other - several aspects of the origin of the Galaxy, star formation and the creation of the elements. Aims. We strive to refine a metal-poor candidate selection method which was developed with simulated Gaia BP/RP spectra, with an ultimate objective of providing the community with both a recipe to select stars for medium/high resolution observations and a catalogue of stellar metallicities. Methods. We used a datased comprised of GALAH DR3 and SAGA database stars in order to verify and adjust to real world data our selection method. For that purpose, we used dereddening as a mean to tackle the issue of extinction, and then we applied our fine-tuned method to select metal-poor candidates, which we thereafter observed and analysed. Results. We were able to infer metallicities for GALAH DR3 and SAGA stars - with color excesses up to E(B-V)<1.5 - with an uncertainty of 0.36 dex, which is good enough for the purpose of identifying new metal-poor stars. Further, we selected 26 metal-poor candidates - via our method - for observations. As spectral analysis showed, 100% of them had [Fe/H]<-2.0, 57% had [Fe/H]<-2.5 and 8% had [Fe/H]<-3.0. We inferred metallicities for these stars with an uncertainty of 0.31 dex, as was proven when comparing to the spectroscopic [Fe/H].

Of the 239 images in the validation dataset, 45 (18.8%) were of genital warts, 43 (18.0%) were of HSV infection, 29 (12.1%) were of penile cancer, 40 (16.7%) were of penile candidiasis, 37 (15.5%) were of syphilitic chancres, and 45 (18.8%) were of non-diseased penises. The overall accuracy of the model for correctly classifying the diseased image was 0.944. Between July 1st and October 1st 2023, there were 2,640 unique users of the mobile platform. Among a random sample of submissions (n=437), 271 (62.0%) were from the United States, 64 (14.6%) from Singapore, 41 (9.4%) from Candia, 40 (9.2%) from the United Kingdom, and 21 (4.8%) from Vietnam. The majority (n=277 [63.4%]) were between 18 and 30 years old. We report on the development of a machine-learning model for classifying five penile diseases, which demonstrated excellent performance on a validation dataset. That model is currently in use globally and has the potential to improve access to diagnostic services for penile diseases.","Wed, 13 Mar 2024 11:05:40 UTC (601 KB)"

As the development of new drugs continues, the potential for unknown adverse effects resulting from DDIs becomes a growing concern. Traditional computational methods for DDI prediction may fail to capture interactions for new drugs due to the lack of knowledge. In this paper, we introduce a new problem setup as zero-shot DDI prediction that deals with the case of new drugs. Leveraging textual information from online databases like DrugBank and PubChem, we propose an innovative approach TextDDI with a language model-based DDI predictor and a reinforcement learning~(RL)-based information selector, enabling the selection of concise and pertinent text for accurate DDI prediction on new drugs. Empirical results show the benefits of the proposed approach on several settings including zero-shot and few-shot DDI prediction, and the selected texts are semantically relevant.

A crucial component of such cloud migrations is the transition of databases to be hosted online. In this work, we consider the difficulties of this migration for SQL databases. While SQL is one of the prominent methods for storing database procedures, there are a plethora of different SQL dialects (e.g., MySQL, Postgres, etc.) which can complicate migrations when the on-premise SQL dialect differs to the dialect hosted on the cloud. Tools exist by common cloud provides such as AWS and Azure to aid in translating between dialects in order to mitigate the majority of the difficulties. However, these tools do not successfully translate $100\%$ of the code. Consequently, software engineers must manually convert the remainder of the untranslated database. For large organizations, this task quickly becomes intractable and so more innovative solutions are required. We consider this challenge a novel yet vital industrial research problem for any large corporation that is considering cloud migrations. Furthermore, we introduce potential avenues of research to tackle this challenge that have yielded promising preliminary results.","Wed, 13 Mar 2024 09:38:39 UTC (64 KB)"

Defending against these attacks in a real-life setting can be compared to the way antivirus software works, with a key consideration being how well the defense can adapt to new and evolving attacks. Another important factor is the resources involved in terms of time and cost for training defense models and updating the model database. Training many models that are specific to each type of attack can be time-consuming and expensive. Ideally, we should be able to train one single model that can handle a wide range of attacks. It appears that a defense method based on image-to-image translation may be capable of this. The proposed versatile defense approach in this paper only requires training one model to effectively resist various unknown adversarial attacks. The trained model has successfully improved the classification accuracy from nearly zero to an average of 86%, performing better than other defense methods proposed in prior studies. When facing the PGD attack and the MI-FGSM attack, versatile defense model even outperforms the attack-specific models trained based on these two attacks. The robustness check also shows that our versatile defense model performs stably regardless with the attack strength.","Wed, 13 Mar 2024 01:48:01 UTC (5,509 KB)"

However, the direct acquisition of HRTFs is cumbersome and requires specialized equipment. Thus, many personalization methods estimate HRTF features from easily obtained anthropometric features of the pinna, head, and torso. The first HRTF notch frequency (N1) is known to be a dominant feature in elevation localization, and thus a useful feature for HRTF personalization. This paper describes the prediction of N1 frequency from pinna anthropometry using a neural model. Prediction is performed separately on three databases, both simulated and measured, and then by domain mixing in-between the databases. The model successfully predicts N1 frequency for individual databases and by domain mixing between some databases. Prediction errors are better or comparable to those previously reported, showing significant improvement when acquired over a large database and with a larger output range.","Tue, 12 Mar 2024 12:07:56 UTC (303 KB)"

Peierls stress is one of the central concepts in crystal plasticity that measures the strength through the resistance of a dislocation to plastic flow. The determination of Peierls stress involves a multiscale nature depending on both elastic lattice responses and the energy landscape of crystal slips. Material screening by strength via the Peierls stress from first-principles calculations is computationally intractable for the nonlocal characteristics of dislocations, and not included in the state-of-the-art computational material databases. In this work, we propose a physics-transfer framework to learn the physics of crystal plasticity from empirical atomistic simulations and then predict the Peierls stress from chemically accurate density functional theory-based calculations of material parameters. Notably, the strengths of single-crystalline metals can be predicted from a few single-point calculations for the deformed lattice and on the {\gamma} surface, allowing efficient, high-throughput screening for material discovery. Uncertainty quantification is carried out to assess the accuracy of models and sources of errors, showing reduced physical and system uncertainties in the predictions by elevating the fidelity of training models. This physics-transfer framework can be generalized to other problems facing the accuracy-performance dilemma, by harnessing the hierarchy of physics in the multiscale models of materials science.","Tue, 12 Mar 2024 11:05:05 UTC (20,171 KB)"

Maier-Hein","Image and Video Processing (eess.IV)","We propose a new method that employs transfer learning techniques to effectively correct sampling selection errors introduced by sparse annotations during supervised learning for automated tumor segmentation. The practicality of current learning-based automated tissue classification approaches is severely impeded by their dependency on manually segmented training databases that need to be recreated for each scenario of application, site, or acquisition setup. The comprehensive annotation of reference datasets can be highly labor-intensive, complex, and error-prone. The proposed method derives high-quality classifiers for the different tissue classes from sparse and unambiguous annotations and employs domain adaptation techniques for effectively correcting sampling selection errors introduced by the sparse sampling. The new approach is validated on labeled, multi-modal MR images of 19 patients with malignant gliomas and by comparative analysis on the BraTS 2013 challenge data sets. Compared to training on fully labeled data, we reduced the time for labeling and training by a factor greater than 70 and 180 respectively without sacrificing accuracy. This dramatically eases the establishment and constant extension of large annotated databases in various scenarios and imaging setups and thus represents an important step towards practical applicability of learning-based approaches in tissue classification.","Tue, 12 Mar 2024 09:17:21 UTC (1,574 KB)"

Previous research on hyperglycemia or glucose detection using ECG has been constrained by challenges related to generalization and scalability, primarily due to using all subjects' ECG in training without considering unseen subjects as a critical factor for developing methods with effective generalization. We designed a deep neural network model capable of identifying significant features across various spatial locations and examining the interdependencies among different features within each convolutional layer. To expedite processing speed, we segment the ECG of each user to isolate one heartbeat or one cycle of the ECG. Our model was trained using data from 727 subjects, while 168 were used for validation. The testing phase involved 224 unseen subjects, with a dataset consisting of 9,000 segments. The result indicates that the proposed algorithm effectively detects hyperglycemia with a 91.60% area under the curve (AUC), 81.05% sensitivity, and 85.54% specificity.","Tue, 12 Mar 2024 03:57:25 UTC (524 KB)"

While processing in main memory can alleviate these penalties, it is becoming increasingly difficult to keep large datasets entirely in main memory. This has led to a recent push for in-storage computation, where processing is performed inside the storage device. We propose TCAM-SSD, a new framework for search-based computation inside the NAND flash memory arrays of a conventional solid-state drive (SSD), which requires lightweight modifications to only the array periphery and firmware. TCAM-SSD introduces a search manager and link table, which can logically partition the NAND flash memory's contents into search-enabled regions and standard storage regions. Together, these light firmware changes enable TCAM-SSD to seamlessly handle block I/O operations, in addition to new search operations, thereby reducing end-to-end execution time and total data movement. We provide an NVMe-compatible interface that provides programmers with the ability to dynamically allocate data on and make use of TCAM-SSD, allowing the system to be leveraged by a wide variety of applications. We evaluate three example use cases of TCAM-SSD to demonstrate its benefits. For transactional databases, TCAM-SSD can mitigate the performance penalties for applications with large datasets, achieving a 60.9% speedup over a conventional system that retrieves data from the SSD and computes using the CPU. For database analytics, TCAM-SSD provides an average speedup of 17.7x over a conventional system for a collection of analytical queries. For graph analytics, we combine TCAM-SSD's associative search with a sparse data structure, speeding up graph computing for larger-than-memory datasets by 14.5%.","Mon, 11 Mar 2024 17:25:01 UTC (2,247 KB)"

However, these improvements primarily focus on recovering the rPPG signal, overlooking the implicit challenges of estimating the heart rate (HR) from the derived signal. While many methods employ the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for HR estimation, the performance of the FFT is inherently affected by a limited frequency resolution. In contrast, the Chirp-Z Transform (CZT), a generalization form of FFT, can refine the spectrum to the narrow-band range of interest for heart rate, providing improved frequential resolution and, consequently, more accurate estimation. This paper presents the advantages of employing the CZT for remote HR estimation and introduces a novel data-driven adaptive CZT estimator. The objective of our proposed model is to tailor the CZT to match the characteristics of each specific dataset sensor, facilitating a more optimal and accurate estimation of HR from the rPPG signal without compromising generalization across diverse datasets. This is achieved through a Sparse Matrix Optimization (SMO). We validate the effectiveness of our model through exhaustive evaluations on three publicly available datasets UCLA-rPPG, PURE, and UBFC-rPPG employing both intra- and cross-database performance metrics. The results reveal outstanding heart rate estimation capabilities, establishing the proposed approach as a robust and versatile estimator for any rPPG method.","Mon, 11 Mar 2024 16:55:19 UTC (11,689 KB)"

In this paper, we focus on the species recognition task in images concerned with large databases, a large number of fine-grained hierarchical classes, severe class imbalance, and varying image quality. We propose a framework for combining individual OOD measures into one combined OOD (COOD) measure using a supervised model. The individual measures are several existing state-of-the-art measures and several novel OOD measures developed with novel class detection and hierarchical class structure in mind. COOD was extensively evaluated on three large-scale (500k+ images) biodiversity datasets in the context of anomaly and novel class detection. We show that COOD outperforms individual, including state-of-the-art, OOD measures by a large margin in terms of TPR@1% FPR in the majority of experiments, e.g., improving detecting ImageNet images (OOD) from 54.3% to 85.4% for the iNaturalist 2018 dataset. SHAP (feature contribution) analysis shows that different individual OOD measures are essential for various tasks, indicating that multiple OOD measures and combinations are needed to generalize. Additionally, we show that explicitly considering ID images that are incorrectly classified for the original (species) recognition task is important for constructing high-performing OOD detection methods and for practical applicability. The framework can easily be extended or adapted to other tasks and media modalities.","Mon, 11 Mar 2024 16:26:35 UTC (5,398 KB)"

While ECG Self-supervised Learning (eSSL) methods show promise in representation learning from unannotated ECG data, they often overlook the clinical knowledge that can be found in reports. This oversight and the requirement for annotated samples for downstream tasks limit eSSL's versatility. In this work, we address these issues with the Multimodal ECG Representation Learning (MERL}) framework. Through multimodal learning on ECG records and associated reports, MERL is capable of performing zero-shot ECG classification with text prompts, eliminating the need for training data in downstream tasks. At test time, we propose the Clinical Knowledge Enhanced Prompt Engineering (CKEPE) approach, which uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to exploit external expert-verified clinical knowledge databases, generating more descriptive prompts and reducing hallucinations in LLM-generated content to boost zero-shot classification. Based on MERL, we perform the first benchmark across six public ECG datasets, showing the superior performance of MERL compared against eSSL methods. Notably, MERL achieves an average AUC score of 75.2% in zero-shot classification (without training data), 3.2% higher than linear probed eSSL methods with 10\% annotated training data, averaged across all six datasets.","Mon, 11 Mar 2024 12:28:55 UTC (31,833 KB)"

We show that relational queries present novel opportunities for accelerating LLM inference, including reordering rows to maximize key-value (KV) cache reuse within the LLM inference engine, reordering columns within a row to further increase cache reuse, and deduplicating redundant inference requests. We implement these optimizations in Apache Spark, with vLLM as the model serving backend and achieve up to 4.4x improvement in end-to-end latency on a benchmark of diverse LLM-based queries on real datasets.

The period corresponding to the center of the HP is investigated as a function of various model assumptions, such as the efficiency of super-adiabatic convection, the mass-luminosity relation, and the metal and helium abundances. The assumed mass-luminosity relation is found to significantly affect the phenomenon but variations in the chemical composition as well as in the stellar mass (at fixed mass-luminosity relation) also play a key role in determining the value of the HP center period. Finally, the predictive capability of the presented theoretical scenario is tested against observed light curves of bump Cepheids in the ESA Gaia database, also considering the variation of the pulsation amplitudes and of the Fourier parameters $R_{21}$ and $\Phi_{21}$ with the pulsation period.

This allows the results of first-principles calculations to be aggregated into a database without extensive provenance information and is a crucial step in building a persistent database of point defects that can grow over time, a key component towards realizing the idea of a ``defect genome' that can yield more complex relationships governing the behavior of defects in materials. We demonstrate several examples of the approach for three technologically relevant materials and highlight current pitfalls that must be considered when employing these methodologies, as well as their potential solutions.","Fri, 8 Mar 2024 21:53:06 UTC (1,291 KB)"
"50","PipeRAG: Fast Retrieval-Augmented Generation via Algorithm-System Co-design","Wenqi Jiang, Shuai Zhang, Boran Han, Jie Wang, Bernie Wang, Tim Kraska","Computation and Language (cs.CL)","Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can enhance the generation quality of large language models (LLMs) by incorporating external token databases. However, retrievals from large databases can constitute a substantial portion of the overall generation time, particularly when retrievals are periodically performed to align the retrieved content with the latest states of generation. In this paper, we introduce PipeRAG, a novel algorithm-system co-design approach to reduce generation latency and enhance generation quality. PipeRAG integrates (1) pipeline parallelism to enable concurrent retrieval and generation processes, (2) flexible retrieval intervals to maximize the efficiency of pipeline parallelism, and (3) a performance model to automatically balance retrieval quality and latency based on the generation states and underlying hardware. Our evaluation shows that, by combining the three aforementioned methods, PipeRAG achieves up to 2.6$\times$ speedup in end-to-end generation latency while improving generation quality. These promising results showcase the effectiveness of co-designing algorithms with underlying systems, paving the way for the adoption of PipeRAG in future RAG systems.","Fri, 8 Mar 2024 21:09:20 UTC (10,178 KB)"
"51","Fast Methods for Computing Photometric Variability of Eccentric Binaries: Boosting, Lensing, and Variable Accretion","Daniel J. D'Orazio, Paul C. Duffell, Christopher Tiede","High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE)","We analyze accretion-rate time series for equal-mass binaries in co-planar gaseous disks spanning a continuous range of orbital eccentricities up to 0.8, for both prograde and retrograde systems. The dominant variability timescales match that of previous investigations; the binary orbital period is dominant for prograde binaries with $e \gtrsim 0.1$, with a 5 times longer ""lump"" period taking over for $e\lesssim 0.1$. This lump period fades and drops from 5 times to 4.5 times the binary period as $e$ approaches 0.1, where it vanishes. For retrograde orbits, the binary orbital period dominates at $e \lesssim 0.55$ and is accompanied by a 2 times longer-timescale periodicity at higher eccentricities. The shape of the accretion-rate time series varies with binary eccentricity. For prograde systems, the orientation of an eccentric disk causes periodic trading of accretion between the binary components in a ratio that we report as a function of binary eccentricity. We present a publicly available tool, binlite, that can rapidly ($\lesssim 0.01$~sec) generate templates for the accretion-rate time series, onto either binary component, for choice of binary eccentricity below 0.8. As an example use-case, we build lightcurve models where the accretion rate through the circumbinary disk and onto each binary component sets contributions to the emitted specific flux. We combine these rest-frame, accretion-variability lightcurves with observer-dependent Doppler boosting and binary self-lensing. This allows a flexible approach to generating lightcurves over a wide range of binary and observer parameter space. We envision binlite as the access point to a living database that will be updated with state-of-the-art hydrodynamical calculations as they advance.","Fri, 8 Mar 2024 19:06:33 UTC (12,983 KB)"

By first approximating neural connections and activities in computer circuits and then creating more and more sophisticated versions of this crude approximation, we are now facing an age to come where modern deep learning-based artificial intelligence systems can rightly be called thinking machines, and they are sometimes even lauded for their emergent behavior and black-box approaches. But as we create more powerful electronic brains, with billions of neural connections and parameters, can we guarantee that these mammoths built of artificial neurons will be able to forget the data that we store in them? If they are at some level like a brain, can the right to be forgotten still be protected while dealing with these AIs? The essential gap between machine learning and the RTBF is explored in this article, with a premonition of far-reaching conclusions if the gap is not bridged or reconciled any time soon. The core argument is that deep learning models, due to their structure and size, cannot be expected to forget or delete a data as it would be expected from a tabular database, and they should be treated more like a mechanical brain, albeit still in development.","Wed, 6 Mar 2024 13:23:57 UTC (174 KB)"

Background: There seem to be differences between creating interventions focused on environmentally sustainable health systems, including nurses, and the scarcity of research on this topic, framed on the Sustainable Development Goals. Methods: A bibliometric analysis was carried out, via three databases (Web of Science, Scopus, and Pubmed), and the guideline recommendations were followed to select bibliometric data. Results: The search resulted in 159 publications, significantly increasing the trends from 2017 to 2021 (p=0.028). The most relevant countries in this area were the United States of America, the United Kingdom, and Sweden. Also, the top articles were from relevant journals, indexed in Journal Citation Report, and the first and the second quartile linked to the nursing field and citations (p<0.001). Conclusion: Education is key to achieving environmentally sustainable health systems via institutions and policies. Implications for nursing management: There is a lack of experimental data and policies on achieving or maintaining environmentally sustainable health care systems, indicating that nurses have an important role and should be consulted and included in decision-making policies regarding sustainability in the healthcare systems.","Mon, 5 Feb 2024 12:14:04 UTC (4,234 KB)"

Existing hallucination benchmarks are either static or lack adjustable complexity for thorough analysis. We contend that utilizing existing relational databases is a promising approach for constructing benchmarks due to their accurate knowledge description via functional dependencies. We propose ERBench to automatically convert any relational database into a benchmark based on the entity-relationship (ER) model. Our key idea is to construct questions using the database schema, records, and functional dependencies such that they can be automatically verified. In addition, we use foreign key constraints to join relations and construct multihop questions, which can be arbitrarily complex and used to debug the intermediate answers of LLMs. Finally, ERBench supports continuous evaluation, multimodal questions, and various prompt engineering techniques. In our experiments, we construct an LLM benchmark using databases of multiple domains and make an extensive comparison of contemporary LLMs. We observe that better LLMs like GPT-4 can handle a larger variety of question types, but are by no means perfect. Also, correct answers do not necessarily imply correct rationales, which is an important evaluation that ERBench does better than other benchmarks for various question types.

We demonstrated FAIM's value in reducing sex and race biases by predicting hospital admission with two real-world databases, MIMIC-IV-ED and SGH-ED. We show that for both datasets, FAIM models not only exhibited satisfactory discriminatory performance but also significantly mitigated biases as measured by well-established fairness metrics, outperforming commonly used bias-mitigation methods. Our approach demonstrates the feasibility of improving fairness without sacrificing performance and provides an a modeling mode that invites domain experts to engage, fostering a multidisciplinary effort toward tailored AI fairness.","Fri, 8 Mar 2024 11:51:00 UTC (1,312 KB)"

However, in 2023, skepticism surfaced within industrial and academic spheres, raising concerns that excitement may outpace actual technological progress. Interoperability, recognized as a major barrier to the Metaverse's full potential, is central to this debate. CoinMarketCap's report in February 2023 indicated that of over 240 metaverse initiatives, most existed in isolation, underscoring the interoperability challenge. Despite consensus on its critical role, there is a research gap in exploring the impact on the Metaverse, significance, and developmental extent. Our study bridges this gap via a systematic literature review and content analysis of the Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus databases, yielding 74 publications after a rigorous selection process. Interoperability, difficult to define due to varied contexts and lack of standardization, is central to the Metaverse, often seen as a digital ecosystem. Urs Gasser's framework from Harvard Law School, outlining technological, data, human, and institutional dimensions, systematically addresses interoperability complexities. Incorporating this framework, we dissect literature for a comprehensive Metaverse interoperability overview. Our study seeks to establish benchmarks for future inquiries, navigating the complex field of Metaverse interoperability studies and contributing to academic advancement.","Fri, 8 Mar 2024 10:38:01 UTC (7,107 KB)"

The probability of accidents occurring in the operation of transformer equipment is high, so it has become a focus of material inspection in recent years. However, the large amount of raw data from sample testing is not being used effectively. Given the above problems, this paper aims to mine the relationship between the unqualified distribution transformer inspection items by using the association rule algorithm based on the distribution transformer inspection data collected from 2017 to 2021 and sorting out the key inspection items. At the same time, the unqualified judgment basis of the relevant items is given, and the internal relationship between the inspection items is clarified to a certain extent. Furthermore, based on material and equipment inspection reports, correlations between failed inspection items, and expert knowledge, the knowledge graph of material equipment inspection management is constructed in the graph database Neo4j. The experimental results show that the FP-Growth method performs significantly better than the Apriori method and can accurately assess the relationship between failed distribution transformer inspection items. Finally, the knowledge graph network is visualized to provide a systematic knowledge base for material inspection, which is convenient for knowledge query and management. This method can provide a scientific guidance program for operation and maintenance personnel to do equipment maintenance and also offers a reference for the state evaluation of other high-voltage equipment.","Fri, 8 Mar 2024 06:02:32 UTC (1,573 KB)"

A classic abstract data type for modelling such an index is a trie. Due to the fundamental nature of this problem, it has sparked much interest, leading to a variety of trie implementations with different characteristics. A trie implementation that has been well-used in practice is the double-array (trie) consisting of merely two integer arrays. While a traversal takes constant time per node visit, the needed space consumption in computer words can be as large as the product of the number of nodes and the alphabet size. Despite that several heuristics have been proposed on lowering the space requirements, we are unaware of any theoretical guarantees. In this paper, we study the decision problem whether there exists a double-array of a given size. To this end, we first draw a connection to the sparse matrix compression problem, which makes our problem NP-complete for alphabet sizes linear to the number of nodes. We further propose a reduction from the restricted directed Hamiltonian path problem, leading to NP-completeness even for logarithmic-sized alphabets.","Thu, 7 Mar 2024 23:41:01 UTC (787 KB)"

The U.S. Department of Energy estimates 33,355 publicly available DC fast charging stations as of September 2023. Range anxiety is an important impediment to the adoption of electric vehicles and is even more relevant in underserved regions in the country. The peer-to-peer energy marketplace helps fill the demand by allowing private home and small business owners to rent their 240 Volt, level-2 charging facilities. The existing, publicly accessible outlets are wrapped with a Cloud-connected microcontroller managing security and charging sessions. These microcontrollers act as Edge devices communicating with a Cloud message broker, while both buyer and seller users interact with the framework via a web-based user interface. The database storage used by the marketplace framework is a key component in both the cost of development and the performance that contributes to the user experience. A traditional storage solution is the SQL database. However, difficulty in scaling across multiple nodes and cost of its server-based compute have resulted in a trend in the last 20 years towards other NoSQL, serverless approaches. In this study, we evaluate the NoSQL vs. SQL solutions through a comparison of Google Cloud Firestore and Cloud SQL MySQL offerings. The comparison pits Google's serverless, document-model, non-relational, NoSQL against the server-base, table-model, relational, SQL service. The evaluation is based on query latency, flexibility/scalability, and cost criteria. Through benchmarking and analysis of the architecture, we determine whether Firestore can support the energy marketplace storage needs and if the introduction of a GraphQL middleware layer can overcome its deficiencies.","Thu, 7 Mar 2024 22:45:06 UTC (2,367 KB)"

Numerous research studies have been attempted with various deep learning models in diagnosis. However, most previous studies had certain limitations, including using publicly available datasets (e.g. MIMIC), and imbalanced data. In this study, we collected five-year electronic health records (EHRs) from the Taiwan hospital database, including 1,420,596 clinical notes, 387,392 laboratory test results, and more than 1,505 laboratory test items, focusing on research pre-training large language models. We proposed a novel Large Language Multimodal Models (LLMMs) framework incorporating multimodal data from clinical notes and laboratory test results for the prediction of chronic disease risk. Our method combined a text embedding encoder and multi-head attention layer to learn laboratory test values, utilizing a deep neural network (DNN) module to merge blood features with chronic disease semantics into a latent space. In our experiments, we observe that clinicalBERT and PubMed-BERT, when combined with attention fusion, can achieve an accuracy of 73% in multiclass chronic diseases and diabetes prediction. By transforming laboratory test values into textual descriptions and employing the Flan T-5 model, we achieved a 76% Area Under the ROC Curve (AUROC), demonstrating the effectiveness of leveraging numerical text data for training and inference in language models. This approach significantly improves the accuracy of early-stage diabetes prediction.","Sat, 2 Mar 2024 22:33:17 UTC (3,668 KB)"

Root cause analysis (RCA), a critical part of the incident management process, is a demanding task for on-call engineers, requiring deep domain knowledge and extensive experience with a team's specific services. Automation of RCA can result in significant savings of time, and ease the burden of incident management on on-call engineers. Recently, researchers have utilized Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform RCA, and have demonstrated promising results. However, these approaches are not able to dynamically collect additional diagnostic information such as incident related logs, metrics or databases, severely restricting their ability to diagnose root causes. In this work, we explore the use of LLM based agents for RCA to address this limitation. We present a thorough empirical evaluation of a ReAct agent equipped with retrieval tools, on an out-of-distribution dataset of production incidents collected at Microsoft. Results show that ReAct performs competitively with strong retrieval and reasoning baselines, but with highly increased factual accuracy. We then extend this evaluation by incorporating discussions associated with incident reports as additional inputs for the models, which surprisingly does not yield significant performance improvements. Lastly, we conduct a case study with a team at Microsoft to equip the ReAct agent with tools that give it access to external diagnostic services that are used by the team for manual RCA. Our results show how agents can overcome the limitations of prior work, and practical considerations for implementing such a system in practice.","Thu, 7 Mar 2024 00:44:01 UTC (578 KB)"

The state-of-the-art text-to-image model, Stable Diffusion, is now capable of synthesizing high-quality images with a strong sense of aesthetics. Crafting text prompts that align with the model's interpretation and the user's intent thus becomes crucial. However, prompting remains challenging for novice users due to the complexity of the stable diffusion model and the non-trivial efforts required for iteratively editing and refining the text prompts. To address these challenges, we propose PromptCharm, a mixed-initiative system that facilitates text-to-image creation through multi-modal prompt engineering and refinement. To assist novice users in prompting, PromptCharm first automatically refines and optimizes the user's initial prompt. Furthermore, PromptCharm supports the user in exploring and selecting different image styles within a large database. To assist users in effectively refining their prompts and images, PromptCharm renders model explanations by visualizing the model's attention values. If the user notices any unsatisfactory areas in the generated images, they can further refine the images through model attention adjustment or image inpainting within the rich feedback loop of PromptCharm. To evaluate the effectiveness and usability of PromptCharm, we conducted a controlled user study with 12 participants and an exploratory user study with another 12 participants. These two studies show that participants using PromptCharm were able to create images with higher quality and better aligned with the user's expectations compared with using two variants of PromptCharm that lacked interaction or visualization support.","Wed, 6 Mar 2024 19:55:01 UTC (23,510 KB)"

The atmospheres of gas giants are dominated by molecular hydrogen, and simultaneous observation of H$_2$ and HD lines provides reliable information on the D/H ratios on these planets. The reference spectroscopic parameters play a crucial role in such studies. Under thermodynamic conditions encountered in these atmospheres, the spectroscopic studies of HD require not only the knowledge of line intensities and positions but also accurate reference data on pressure-induced line shapes and shifts. Our aim is to provide accurate collision-induced line-shape parameters for HD lines that cover any thermodynamic conditions relevant to the atmospheres of giant planets, i.e., any relevant temperature, pressure, and perturbing gas (the H$_2$/He mixture) composition. We perform quantum-scattering calculations on a new highly accurate ab initio potential energy surface, and we use scattering S-matrices obtained this way to determine the collision-induced line-shape parameters. We use the cavity ring-down spectroscopy for validation of our theoretical methodology. We report accurate collision-induced line-shape parameters for the pure rotational R(0), R(1), and R(2) lines, the most relevant HD lines for the investigations of atmospheres of the giant planets. Besides the basic Voigt-profile collisional parameters (i.e. the broadening and shift parameters), we also report their speed dependences and the complex Dicke parameter, which can influence the effective width and height of the HD lines up to almost a factor of 2 for giant planet conditions. The sub-percent-level accuracy, reached in this work, considerably improves the previously available data. All the reported parameters are consistent with the HITRAN database format, hence allowing for the use of HAPI for generating the beyond-Voigt spectra of HD.","Wed, 6 Mar 2024 14:36:27 UTC (13,257 KB)"

RMP-ELM suppression is achieved over a range of plasma currents, toroidal fields, and RMP toroidal mode numbers. Consistent operational windows in edge safety factor are found across devices, while windows in plasma shaping parameters are distinct. Accessed pedestal parameters reveal a quantitatively similar pedestal-top density limit for RMP-ELM suppression in all devices of just over 3x1019 m-3. This is surprising given the wide variance of many engineering parameters and edge collisionalities, and poses a challenge to extrapolation of the regime. Wide ranges in input power, confinement time, and stored energy are observed, with the achieved triple product found to scale like the product of current, field, and radius. Observed energy confinement scaling with engineering parameters for RMP-ELM suppressed plasmas are presented and compared with expectations from established H and L-mode scalings, including treatment of uncertainty analysis. Different scaling exponents for individual engineering parameters are found as compared to the established scalings. However, extrapolation to next-step tokamaks ITER and SPARC find overall consistency within uncertainties with the established scalings, finding no obvious performance penalty when extrapolating from the assembled multi-device RMP-ELM suppressed database. Overall this work identifies common physics for RMP-ELM suppression and highlights the need to pursue this no-ELM regime at higher magnetic field and different plasma physical size.","Wed, 6 Mar 2024 13:18:53 UTC (9,261 KB)"

The approach uses the a priori distribution of citations in each field to estimate the expected a posteriori distribution in that field. This distribution is then employed to normalize the citations received by a publication in that field. Our main contribution is the Bayesian Impact Score, a measure of the impact of a publication. This score is increasing and concave with the number of citations received and decreasing and convex with the age of the publication. This means that the marginal score of an additional citation decreases as the cumulative number of citations increases and increases as the time since publication of the document grows.

However, not many researches have found that discuss the advantages and drawbacks, as well as performance comparison amongst spectral feature extractors. In this consideration, this paper aims to comparing the attributes of these two transform types, called spectrogram and scalogram. A Convolutional Neural Networks for acoustic faults recognition is implemented, then the performance of these two types of spectral extractor is recorded for comparison. A latest research on the same audio database is considered for benchmarking to see how good the designed spectrogram and scalogram is. The advantages and limitations of them are also analyzed. By doing so, the results of this paper provide indications for application scenarios of spectrogram and scalogram, as well as potential further research directions in acoustic recognition.","Wed, 6 Mar 2024 11:02:07 UTC (1,588 KB)"

Comparison of hysteresis operator approach to multi-scale model","Davide Manfredo, Mohammad Ali Saadat, Vanessa Dörlich, Joachim Linn, Damien Durville, Martin Arnold","Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)","The simulation of inelastic effects in flexible slender technical devices has become of increasing interest in the past years. Different approaches have been considered depending on the effects relevant for the specific application. Recently, a mixed stress strain driven computational homogenisation has been proposed to model the dissipative nonlinear bending response of spiral strands subjected to axial force. In this study, we propose two different approaches, namely a rheological model and a databased greybox model, to predict the cyclic response of these strands using only their monotonic response. In the first approach, a system of so-called bending springs and sliders is used to model different contributions to the bending stiffness of the strands. The data-based approach makes use of mathematical tools called hysteresis operators. The Prandtl-Ishlinskii operator plays a relevant role in modelling the input-output relation in phenomena showing hysteretic behaviour and can be expressed as a weighted superposition of elementary stop operators. Comparing the two approaches leads to a better understanding and an explicit physical interpretation of the parameters of a specific class of hysteresis operator models.","Wed, 6 Mar 2024 08:01:58 UTC (1,329 KB)"

Li","Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS)","We introduce a new notion of neighboring databases for coverage problems such as Max Cover and Set Cover under differential privacy. In contrast to the standard privacy notion for these problems, which is analogous to node-privacy in graphs, our new definition gives a more fine-grained privacy guarantee, which is analogous to edge-privacy. We illustrate several scenarios of Set Cover and Max Cover where our privacy notion is desired one for the application. Our main result is an $\epsilon$-edge differentially private algorithm for Max Cover which obtains an $(1-1/e-\eta,\tilde{O}(k/\epsilon))$-approximation with high probability. Furthermore, we show that this result is nearly tight: we give a lower bound show that an additive error of $\Omega(k/\epsilon)$ is necessary under edge-differential privacy. Via group privacy properties, this implies a new algorithm for $\epsilon$-node differentially private Max Cover which obtains an $(1-1/e-\eta,\tilde{O}(fk/\epsilon))$-approximation, where $f$ is the maximum degree of an element in the set system. When $f\ll k$, this improves over the best known algorithm for Max Cover under pure (node) differential privacy, which obtains an $(1-1/e,\tilde{O}(k^2/\epsilon))$-approximation.","Tue, 5 Mar 2024 21:40:10 UTC (50 KB)"

This claim has previously been studied only in the single-winner case. We investigate how susceptible STV is to the spoiler effect in multiwinner elections, where the output of the voting method is a committee of size at least two. To evaluate STV we compare it to numerous other voting methods including single non-transferable vote, $k$-Borda, and the Chamberlin-Courant rule. We provide simulation results under three different random models and empirical results using a large database of real-world multiwinner political elections from Scotland. Our results show that STV is not spoiler-proof in any meaningful sense in the multiwinner context, but it tends to perform well relative to other methods, especially when using real-world ballot data.","Sun, 3 Mar 2024 19:10:26 UTC (35 KB)"

Most early measurements are obtained via single-dish telescopes with substantial source confusion, whereas recent interferometric observations are limited to small areas. We used a large database of ALMA continuum observations to accurately measure galaxy number counts in multiple (sub)millimetre bands, thus bridging the flux density range between single-dish surveys and deep interferometric studies. We continued the Automated Mining of the ALMA Archive in the COSMOS Field project (A3COSMOS) and extended it with observations from the GOODS-South field (A3GOODSS). The database consists of ~4,000 pipeline-processed continuum images from the public ALMA archive, yielding 2,050 unique detected sources. To infer galaxy number counts, we constructed a method to reduce the observational bias inherent to targeted pointings that dominate the database. This method comprises a combination of image selection, masking, and source weighting. The effective area was calculated by accounting for inhomogeneous wavelengths, sensitivities, and resolutions and for spatial overlap between images. We tested and calibrated our method with simulations. We obtained the first number counts derived in a consistent and homogeneous way in four different ALMA bands covering a relatively large area. The results are consistent with number counts from the literature within the uncertainties. We extended the available depth in ALMA Band 4 by 0.4 dex with respect to previous studies. In Band 7, at the depth of the inferred number counts, ~40% of the cosmic infrared background is resolved into discrete sources. This fraction, however, decreases with wavelength, reaching ~4% in Band 3. Finally, we used the number counts to test models of dusty galaxy evolution, and find a good agreement within the uncertainties.","Tue, 5 Mar 2024 17:12:13 UTC (3,811 KB)"

Medeiros, Sayan Mukherjee, Andrea Agazzi","Computation (stat.CO)","The generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) is a popular statistical approach for handling correlated data, and is used extensively in applications areas where big data is common, including biomedical data settings. The focus of this paper is scalable statistical inference for the GLMM, where we define statistical inference as: (i) estimation of population parameters, and (ii) evaluation of scientific hypotheses in the presence of uncertainty. Artificial intelligence (AI) learning algorithms excel at scalable statistical estimation, but rarely include uncertainty quantification. In contrast, Bayesian inference provides full statistical inference, since uncertainty quantification results automatically from the posterior distribution. Unfortunately, Bayesian inference algorithms, including Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), become computationally intractable in big data settings. In this paper, we introduce a statistical inference algorithm at the intersection of AI and Bayesian inference, that leverages the scalability of modern AI algorithms with guaranteed uncertainty quantification that accompanies Bayesian inference. Our algorithm is an extension of stochastic gradient MCMC with novel contributions that address the treatment of correlated data (i.e., intractable marginal likelihood) and proper posterior variance estimation. Through theoretical and empirical results we establish our algorithm's statistical inference properties, and apply the method in a large electronic health records database.","Tue, 5 Mar 2024 14:35:34 UTC (455 KB)"

The resulting formalism allows us to perform reasoning about data associated with degrees of uncertainty while preserving computational complexity results and the applicability of reasoning techniques established for the standard Datalog setting. In particular, we provide fuzzy extensions of Datalog chases which produce fuzzy universal models and we exploit them to show that in important fragments of the language, reasoning has the same complexity as in the classical setting.","Tue, 5 Mar 2024 12:51:40 UTC (907 KB)"

They are involved in a wide range of biological roles because of their exceptionally unique and distinct structural characteristics. After the completion of the human genome sequencing project, a lot of bioinformatic algorithms were introduced to predict the active G4s regions \textit{in vitro} based on the canonical G4 sequence elements, G-\textit{richness}, and G-\textit{skewness}, as well as the non-canonical sequence features. Recently, sequencing techniques like G4-seq and G4-ChIP-seq were developed to map the G4s \textit{in vitro}, and \textit{in vivo} respectively at a few hundred base resolution. Subsequently, several machine learning approaches were developed for predicting the G4 regions using the existing databases. However, their prediction models were simplistic, and the prediction accuracy was notably poor. In response, here, we propose a novel convolutional neural network with Bi-LSTM and attention layers, named G4-attention, to predict the G4 forming sequences with improved accuracy. G4-attention achieves high accuracy and attains state-of-the-art results in the G4 prediction task. Our model also predicts the G4 regions accurately in the highly class-imbalanced datasets. In addition, the developed model trained on the human genome dataset can be applied to any non-human genome DNA sequences to predict the G4 formation propensities.","Tue, 5 Mar 2024 08:34:04 UTC (2,466 KB)"

For a fine-tuning of molecular properties without losing bio-activity validated in advance, the concept of bioisosterism has emerged. Many in silico methods have been proposed for discovering bioisosteres, but they require expert knowledge for their applications or are restricted to known databases. Here, we introduce DeepBioisostere, a deep generative model to design suitable bioisosteric replacements. Our model allows an end-to-end chemical replacement by intelligently selecting fragments for removal and insertion along with their attachment orientation.

DeepBioisostere can also provide previously unseen bioisosteric replacements, highlighting its capability for exploring diverse chemical modifications rather than just mining them from known databases. Lastly, we employed DeepBioisostere to improve the sensitivity of a known SARS-CoV-2 main protease inhibitor to the E166V mutant that exhibits drug resistance to the inhibitor, demonstrating its potential application in lead optimization.","Tue, 5 Mar 2024 06:55:43 UTC (12,779 KB)"

The rich privacy information in palmprint data necessitates its protection to ensure security and privacy without sacrificing system performance. Existing systems often use cancelable technologies to protect templates, but these technologies ignore the potential risk of data leakage. Upon breaching the system and gaining access to the stored database, a hacker could easily manipulate the stored templates, compromising the security of the verification system. To address this issue, we propose a dual-level cancelable palmprint verification framework in this paper. Specifically, the raw template is initially encrypted using a competition hashing network with a first-level token, facilitating the end-to-end generation of cancelable templates. Different from previous works, the protected template undergoes further encryption to differentiate the second-level protected template from the first-level one. The system specifically creates a negative database (NDB) with the second-level token for dual-level protection during the enrollment stage. Reversing the NDB is NP-hard and a fine-grained algorithm for NDB generation is introduced to manage the noise and specified bits. During the verification stage, we propose an NDB matching algorithm based on matrix operation to accelerate the matching process of previous NDB methods caused by dictionary-based matching rules. This approach circumvents the need to store templates identical to those utilized for verification, reducing the risk of potential data leakage. Extensive experiments conducted on public palmprint datasets have confirmed the effectiveness and generality of the proposed framework.

Therefore, this study aims to overcome the limitations of ground-truth sampling and improve the performance of 3D object detection models by developing a new augmentation technique called false-positive sampling. False-positive sampling involves retraining the model using point clouds that are identified as false positives in the model's predictions.

Additionally, we analyze the principles behind the performance enhancement due to false-positive sampling and propose a technique that applies the concept of curriculum learning to the sampling strategy that encompasses both false-positive and ground-truth sampling techniques. Our experiments demonstrate that models utilizing false-positive sampling show a reduction in false positives and exhibit improved object detection performance.

However, the task of Arabic sentiment analysis (ASA) is still underrepresented in the body of research. This study offers the first in-depth and in-breadth analysis of existing ASA studies of textual content and identifies their common themes, domains of application, methods, approaches, technologies and algorithms used. The in-depth study manually analyses 133 ASA papers published in the English language between 2002 and 2020 from four academic databases (SAGE, IEEE, Springer, WILEY) and from Google Scholar. The in-breadth study uses modern, automatic machine learning techniques, such as topic modelling and temporal analysis, on Open Access resources, to reinforce themes and trends identified by the prior study, on 2297 ASA publications between 2010-2020. The main findings show the different approaches used for ASA: machine learning, lexicon-based and hybrid approaches. Other findings include ASA 'winning' algorithms (SVM, NB, hybrid methods). Deep learning methods, such as LSTM can provide higher accuracy, but for ASA sometimes the corpora are not large enough to support them. Additionally, whilst there are some ASA corpora and lexicons, more are required. Specifically, Arabic tweets corpora and datasets are currently only moderately sized. Moreover, Arabic lexicons that have high coverage contain only Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) words, and those with Arabic dialects are quite small. Thus, new corpora need to be created. On the other hand, ASA tools are stringently lacking. There is a need to develop ASA tools that can be used in industry, as well as in academia, for Arabic text SA. Hence, our study offers insights into the challenges associated with ASA research and provides suggestions for ways to move the field forward such as lack of Dialectical Arabic resource, Arabic tweets, corpora and data sets for SA.","Mon, 4 Mar 2024 10:37:48 UTC (864 KB)"

The algorithm takes as input a set of relational conjunctive (select-from-where) queries, one for each input table, from the three column (subject, predicate, object) output RDF schema to the input table's relational schema. The algorithm's output is the only set of RDF triples for which a unique round-trip of the input data under the relational queries exists. The output may contain blank nodes, is unique up to unique isomorphism, and can be obtained using elementary formal methods (equational theorem proving and term model construction specifically). We also describe how (generalized) homomorphisms between graphs can be used to write such relational conjunctive (select-from-where) queries, which, due to the lack of structure in the three-column RDF schema, tend to be large in practice.

Real-time recurrent learning (RTRL), is a potential solution as it can learn patterns within non-stationary respiratory data but has high complexity. This study assesses the capabilities of resource-efficient online RNN algorithms, namely unbiased online recurrent optimization (UORO), sparse-1 step approximation (SnAp-1), and decoupled neural interfaces (DNI) to forecast respiratory motion during radiotherapy treatment accurately. We use time series containing the 3D position of external markers on the chest of healthy subjects. We propose efficient implementations for SnAp-1 and DNI based on compression of the influence and immediate Jacobian matrices and an accurate update of the linear coefficients used in credit assignment estimation, respectively. The original sampling frequency was 10Hz; we performed resampling at 3.33Hz and 30Hz. We use UORO, SnAp-1, and DNI to forecast each marker's 3D position with horizons (the time interval in advance for which the prediction is made) h<=2.1s and compare them with RTRL, least mean squares, and linear regression. RNNs trained online achieved similar or better accuracy than most previous works using larger training databases and deep learning, even though we used only the first minute of each sequence to predict motion within that exact sequence. SnAp-1 had the lowest normalized root mean square errors (nRMSE) averaged over the horizon values considered, equal to 0.335 and 0.157, at 3.33Hz and 10.0Hz, respectively. Similarly, UORO had the highest accuracy at 30Hz, with an nRMSE of 0.0897.

Given a capacity $k \in \mathbb{Z}^+$, and a directed graph $G=(V,E)$ where each vertex has a size in $\{0,1, \ldots,k\}$, we seek a collection of subsets of vertices $S_1, \ldots, S_m$ that cover all the vertices, such that for any $1 \leq j \leq m$, the total size of vertices in $S_j$ is bounded by $k$, and there are no edges from $V \setminus S_j$ to $S_j$. The objective is to minimize the number of subsets $m$. CPO is closely related to the rule caching problem (RCP) that is of wide interest in the networking area. The input for RCP is a directed graph $G=(V,E)$, a profit function $p:V \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_{0}^+$, and $k \in \mathbb{Z}^+$. The output is a subset $S \subseteq V$ of maximum profit such that $|S| \leq k$ and there are no edges from $V \setminus S$ to $S$. Our main result is a $2$-approximation algorithm for CPO on out-trees, complemented by an asymptotic $1.5$-hardness of approximation result. We also give a two-way reduction between RCP and the densest $k$-subhypergraph problem, surprisingly showing that the problems are equivalent w.r.t. polynomial-time approximation within any factor $\rho \geq 1$. This implies that RCP cannot be approximated within factor $|V|^{1-\eps}$ for any fixed $\eps>0$, under standard complexity assumptions. Prior to this work, RCP was just known to be strongly NP-hard. We further show that there is no EPTAS for the special case of RCP where the profits are uniform, assuming Gap-ETH. Since this variant admits a PTAS, we essentially resolve the complexity status of this problem.","Sun, 3 Mar 2024 17:17:08 UTC (227 KB)"

This task is challenging due to textual and semantic heterogeneity, as well as differences in schema sizes. Although machine-learning-based solutions have been explored in numerous studies, they often suffer from low accuracy, require manual mapping of the schemas for model training, or need access to source schema data which might be unavailable due to privacy concerns. In this paper we present a novel method, named ReMatch, for matching schemas using retrieval-enhanced Large Language Models (LLMs). Our method avoids the need for predefined mapping, any model training, or access to data in the source database. In the ReMatch method the tables of the target schema and the attributes of the source schema are first represented as structured passage-based documents. For each source attribute document, we retrieve $J$ documents, representing target schema tables, according to their semantic relevance. Subsequently, we create a prompt for every source table, comprising all its attributes and their descriptions, alongside all attributes from the set of top $J$ target tables retrieved previously. We employ LLMs using this prompt for the matching task, yielding a ranked list of $K$ potential matches for each source attribute. Our experimental results on large real-world schemas demonstrate that ReMatch significantly improves matching capabilities and outperforms other machine learning approaches. By eliminating the requirement for training data, ReMatch becomes a viable solution for real-world scenarios.","Sun, 3 Mar 2024 17:14:40 UTC (611 KB)"

This approach, while well-suited for machine-learned interatomic potentials, is conceptually at odds with learning complex intrinsic properties of materials, often driven by spectral properties commonly represented in reciprocal space (e.g., band gaps or mobilities) which cannot be readily atomically partitioned. For such applications, methods which represent the electronic rather than the atomic structure could be more promising. In this work, we present a general framework focused on electronic-structure descriptors which take advantage of the natural symmetries and inherent interpretability of physical models. Using this framework, we formulate two such representations and apply them respectively to measuring the similarity of carbon nanotubes and barium titanate polymorphs, and to the discovery of novel transparent conducting materials (TCMs) in the Materials Cloud 3D database (MC3D). A random forest classifier trained on 1% of the materials in the MC3D is able to correctly label 76% of entries in database which meet common screening criteria for promising TCMs.","Sun, 3 Mar 2024 13:37:51 UTC (10,494 KB)"

However, most present GNN-based methods for NIDS are supervised or semi-supervised. Network flows need to be manually annotated as supervisory labels, a process that is time-consuming or even impossible, making NIDS difficult to adapt to potentially complex attacks, especially in large-scale real-world scenarios. The existing GNN-based self-supervised methods focus on the binary classification of network flow as benign or not, and thus fail to reveal the types of attack in practice. This paper studies the application of GNNs to identify the specific types of network flows in an unsupervised manner. We first design an encoder to obtain graph embedding, that introduces the graph attention mechanism and considers the edge information as the only essential factor. Then, a self-supervised method based on graph contrastive learning is proposed. The method samples center nodes, and for each center node, generates subgraph by it and its direct neighbor nodes, and corresponding contrastive subgraph from the interpolated graph, and finally constructs positive and negative samples from subgraphs. Furthermore, a structured contrastive loss function based on edge features and graph local topology is introduced. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first GNN-based self-supervised method for the multiclass classification of network flows in NIDS. Detailed experiments conducted on four real-world databases (NF-Bot-IoT, NF-Bot-IoT-v2, NF-CSE-CIC-IDS2018, and NF-CSE-CIC-IDS2018-v2) systematically compare our model with the state-of-the-art supervised and self-supervised models, illustrating the considerable potential of our method.

Ensuring the integrity and traceability of data across these distributed environments, however, remains a critical challenge. The ability to create transparent artificial intelligence, such as detailing the training process of a machine learning model, has become an increasingly prominent concern due to the large number of sensitive (hyper)parameters it utilizes; thus, it is imperative to strike a reasonable balance between openness and the need to protect sensitive information. In this paper, we propose one of the first approaches to enhance data provenance and model transparency in federated learning systems. Our methodology leverages a combination of cryptographic techniques and efficient model management to track the transformation of data throughout the FL process, and seeks to increase the reproducibility and trustworthiness of a trained FL model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through experimental evaluations on diverse FL scenarios, showcasing its ability to tackle accountability and explainability across the board. Our findings show that our system can greatly enhance data transparency in various FL environments by storing chained cryptographic hashes and client model snapshots in our proposed design for data decoupled FL. This is made possible by also employing multiple optimization techniques which enables comprehensive data provenance without imposing substantial computational loads. Extensive experimental results suggest that integrating a database subsystem into federated learning systems can improve data provenance in an efficient manner, encouraging secure FL adoption in privacy-sensitive applications and paving the way for future advancements in FL transparency and security features.","Sun, 3 Mar 2024 09:08:41 UTC (771 KB)"

Yang, Bo Luo, Kaitai Liang","Cryptography and Security (cs.CR)","Dynamic Searchable Encryption (DSE) has emerged as a solution to efficiently handle and protect large-scale data storage in encrypted databases (EDBs). Volume leakage poses a significant threat, as it enables adversaries to reconstruct search queries and potentially compromise the security and privacy of data. Padding strategies are common countermeasures for the leakage, but they significantly increase storage and communication costs. In this work, we develop a new perspective to handle volume leakage. We start with distinct search and further explore a new concept called \textit{distinct} DSE (\textit{d}-DSE). We also define new security notions, in particular Distinct with Volume-Hiding security, as well as forward and backward privacy, for the new concept. Based on \textit{d}-DSE, we construct the \textit{d}-DSE designed EDB with related constructions for distinct keyword (d-KW-\textit{d}DSE), keyword (KW-\textit{d}DSE), and join queries (JOIN-\textit{d}DSE) and update queries in encrypted databases. We instantiate a concrete scheme \textsf{BF-SRE}, employing Symmetric Revocable Encryption. We conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets, such as Crime, Wikipedia, and Enron, for performance evaluation. The results demonstrate that our scheme is practical in data search and with comparable computational performance to the SOTA DSE scheme (\textsf{MITRA}*, \textsf{AURA}) and padding strategies (\textsf{SEAL}, \textsf{ShieldDB}).

Yang, Kaitai Liang","Cryptography and Security (cs.CR)","Searchable symmetric encryption schemes often unintentionally disclose certain sensitive information, such as access, volume, and search patterns. Attackers can exploit such leakages and other available knowledge related to the user's database to recover queries. We find that the effectiveness of query recovery attacks depends on the volume/frequency distribution of keywords. Queries containing keywords with high volumes/frequencies are more susceptible to recovery, even when countermeasures are implemented. Attackers can also effectively leverage these ``special'' queries to recover all others. By exploiting the above finding, we propose a Jigsaw attack that begins by accurately identifying and recovering those distinctive queries. Leveraging the volume, frequency, and co-occurrence information, our attack achieves $90\%$ accuracy in three tested datasets, which is comparable to previous attacks (Oya et al., USENIX' 22 and Damie et al., USENIX' 21). With the same runtime, our attack demonstrates an advantage over the attack proposed by Oya et al (approximately $15\%$ more accuracy when the keyword universe size is 15k). Furthermore, our proposed attack outperforms existing attacks against widely studied countermeasures, achieving roughly $60\%$ and $85\%$ accuracy against the padding and the obfuscation, respectively. In this context, with a large keyword universe ($\geq$3k), it surpasses current state-of-the-art attacks by more than $20\%$.","Sat, 2 Mar 2024 09:57:05 UTC (17,741 KB)"

DFIN uniquely alternates between prompting techniques and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), adapting to the size and complexity of the database schema. A preprocessing phase embeds database definitions and leverages annotated files, akin to those in the BIRD dataset, facilitating the runtime retrieval of pertinent schema information. This strategy significantly reduces the token count for schema linking prompts, enabling the use of a standard GPT-4 model over its larger context variant, thus handling large-scale databases more effectively and economically. Our evaluation on the BIRD dataset, a challenging real-world benchmark, demonstrates that DFIN not only scales efficiently but also improves accuracy, achieving a score of 51.69. This improvement surpasses DIN-SQL method (the current third-place), which is the highest-ranked model employing in-context learning rather than fine-tuning, previously scoring 50.72.

Polyps, as the main biomarker of the disease, are detected, localized, and characterized through colonoscopy procedures. Nonetheless, during the examination, up to 25% of polyps are missed, because of challenging conditions (camera movements, lighting changes), and the close similarity of polyps and intestinal folds. Besides, there is a remarked subjectivity and expert dependency to observe and detect abnormal regions along the intestinal tract. Currently, publicly available polyp datasets have allowed significant advances in computational strategies dedicated to characterizing non-parametric polyp shapes. These computational strategies have achieved remarkable scores of up to 90% in segmentation tasks. Nonetheless, these strategies operate on cropped and expert-selected frames that always observe polyps. In consequence, these computational approximations are far from clinical scenarios and real applications, where colonoscopies are redundant on intestinal background with high textural variability. In fact, the polyps typically represent less than 1% of total observations in a complete colonoscopy record. This work introduces COLON: the largest COlonoscopy LONg sequence dataset with around of 30 thousand polyp labeled frames and 400 thousand background frames. The dataset was collected from a total of 30 complete colonoscopies with polyps at different stages, variations in preparation procedures, and some cases the observation of surgical instrumentation. Additionally, 10 full intestinal background video control colonoscopies were integrated in order to achieve a robust polyp-background frame differentiation.

The steady increase in atmospheric CO2 levels, largely due to human activities such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation, has become a major contributor to climate change and its associated catastrophic effects. To tackle this pressing challenge, a coordinated global effort is needed, which necessitates a deep understanding of emissions patterns and trends. In this paper, we explore the use of statistical modelling, specifically the lognormal distribution, as a framework for comprehending and predicting CO2 emissions. We build on prior research that suggests a complex distribution of emissions and seek to test the hypothesis that a simpler distribution can still offer meaningful insights for policy-makers. We utilize data from three comprehensive databases and analyse six candidate distributions (exponential, Fisk, gamma, lognormal, Lomax, Weibull) to identify a suitable model for global fossil CO2 emissions. Our findings highlight the adequacy of the lognormal distribution in characterizing emissions across all countries and years studied. Furthermore, to provide additional support for this distribution, we provide statistical evidence supporting the applicability of Gibrat's law to those CO2 emissions. Finally, we employ the lognormal model to predict emission parameters for the coming years and propose two policies for reducing total fossil CO2 emissions.

Specifically, our model comprises a base quality predictor, a spatial rectifier, and a temporal rectifier, responding to the visual content and distortion, spatial resolution, and frame rate changes on video quality, respectively. During training, spatial and temporal rectifiers are dropped out with some probabilities so as to make the base quality predictor a standalone BVQA model, which should work better with the rectifiers. Extensive experiments on both professionally-generated content and user generated content video databases show that our quality model achieves superior or comparable performance to current methods. Furthermore, the modularity of our model offers a great opportunity to analyze existing video quality databases in terms of their spatial and temporal complexities. Last, our BVQA model is cost-effective to add other quality-relevant video attributes such as dynamic range and color gamut as additional rectifiers.","Thu, 29 Feb 2024 15:44:00 UTC (5,636 KB)[v2] Tue, 5 Mar 2024 02:48:07 UTC (5,636 KB)[v3] Wed, 13 Mar 2024 08:24:51 UTC (5,620 KB)"

Henriques, Andrew Zisserman, Samuel Albanie, A. Sophia Koepke","Audio and Speech Processing (eess.AS)","Video databases from the internet are a valuable source of text-audio retrieval datasets. However, given that sound and vision streams represent different ""views"" of the data, treating visual descriptions as audio descriptions is far from optimal. Even if audio class labels are present, they commonly are not very detailed, making them unsuited for text-audio retrieval. To exploit relevant audio information from video-text datasets, we introduce a methodology for generating audio-centric descriptions using Large Language Models (LLMs). In this work, we consider the egocentric video setting and propose three new text-audio retrieval benchmarks based on the EpicMIR and EgoMCQ tasks, and on the EpicSounds dataset. Our approach for obtaining audio-centric descriptions gives significantly higher zero-shot performance than using the original visual-centric descriptions. Furthermore, we show that using the same prompts, we can successfully employ LLMs to improve the retrieval on EpicSounds, compared to using the original audio class labels of the dataset. Finally, we confirm that LLMs can be used to determine the difficulty of identifying the action associated with a sound.","Thu, 29 Feb 2024 12:38:43 UTC (4,219 KB)"

Korsun","Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)","This study introduces an approach to detecting exocomet transits in the dataset of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), specifically within its Sector 1. Given the limited number of exocomet transits detected in the observed light curves, creating a sufficient training sample for the machine learning method was challenging. We developed a unique training sample by encapsulating simulated asymmetric transit profiles into observed light curves, thereby creating realistic data for the model training. To analyze these light curves, we employed the TSFresh software, which was a tool for extracting key features that were then used to refine our Random Forest model training. Considering that cometary transits typically exhibit a small depth, less than 1% of the star's brightness, we chose to limit our sample to the CDPP parameter. Our study focused on two target samples: light curves with a CDPP of less than 40 ppm and light curves with a CDPP of up to 150 ppm. Each sample was accompanied by a corresponding training set. This methodology achieved an accuracy of approximately 96%, with both precision and recall rates exceeding 95% and a balanced F1-score of around 96%. This level of accuracy was effective in distinguishing between 'exocomet candidate' and 'non-candidate' classifications for light curves with a CDPP of less than 40 ppm, and our model identified 12 potential exocomet candidates. However, when applying machine learning to less accurate light curves (CDPP up to 150 ppm), we noticed a significant increase in curves that could not be confidently classified, but even in this case, our model identified 20 potential exocomet candidates. These promising results within Sector 1 motivate us to extend our analysis across all TESS sectors to detect and study comet-like activity in the extrasolar planetary systems.","Thu, 29 Feb 2024 12:01:23 UTC (644 KB)"

The study addresses the uncertainty arising from the growing complexity of modern products. The method uses scenario analysis and focuses on failure analysis within technical product development. The approach involves a derivation of influencing factors based on information from failure databases. The failures described here are documented individually in failure sequence diagrams and then related to each other in a relationship matrix.

Drouin, Gregory B. Rieker","Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics (physics.ao-ph)","We present broadband dual frequency comb laser absorption measurements of 2% H$_2$O (natural isotopic abundance of 99.7% H$_2^{16}$O) in air from 6600-7650 cm$^{-1}$ (1307-1515 nm) with a spectral point spacing of 0.0068 cm$^{-1}$. Twenty-nine datasets were collected at temperatures between 300 and 1300 K ($\pm$0.82% average uncertainty) and pressures ranging from 20 to 600 Torr ($\pm$0.25%) with an average residual absorbance noise of 8.0E-4 across the spectrum for all measurements. We fit measurements using a quadratic speed-dependent Voigt profile to determine 7088 absorption parameters for 3366 individual transitions found in HITRAN2020. These measurements build on the line strength, line center, self-broadening, and self-shift parameters determined in the Part I companion of this work. Here we measure air-broadened width (with temperature- and speed-dependence) and air pressure shift (with temperature dependence) parameters. Various trends are explored for extrapolation to weak transitions that were not covered in this work. Improvements made in this work are predominantly due to the inclusion of air pressure shift temperature dependence values. In aggregate, these updates improved RMS absorbance error by a factor of 4.2 on average, and the remaining residual is predominantly spectral noise. This updated database improves high temperature spectroscopic knowledge across the 6600 7650 cm$^{-1}$ region of H$_2$O absorption.","Wed, 28 Feb 2024 04:26:04 UTC (3,801 KB)"

There are still multiple modeling gaps that need to be addressed; if not, they can lead to inaccurate operation and planning reliability studies, and consequently to unintentional load shedding or even blackouts.

Hajjar, Hao Sun","Applied Physics (physics.app-ph)","There is a growing interest in utilizing machine learning (ML) methods for structural metamodeling due to the substantial computational cost of traditional numerical simulations. The existing data-driven strategies show potential limitations to the model robustness and interpretability as well as the dependency of rich data. To address these challenges, this paper presents a novel physics-informed machine learning (PiML) method, which incorporates scientific principles and physical laws into deep neural networks for modeling seismic responses of nonlinear structures. The basic concept is to constrain the solution space of the ML model within known physical bounds. This is made possible with three main features, namely, model order reduction, a long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, and Newton's second law (e.g., the equation of motion). Model order reduction is essential for handling structural systems with inherent redundancy and enhancing model efficiency. The LSTM network captures temporal dependencies, enabling accurate prediction of time series responses. The equation of motion is manipulated to learn system nonlinearities and confines the solution space within physically interpretable results. These features enable model training with relatively sparse data and offer benefits in terms of accuracy, interpretability, and robustness. Furthermore, a dataset of seismically designed archetype ductile planar steel moment resistant frames under horizontal seismic loading, available in the DesignSafe-CI Database, is considered for evaluation of the proposed method. The resulting metamodel is capable of handling more complex data compared to existing physics-guided LSTM models and outperforms other non-physics data-driven neural networks.","Wed, 28 Feb 2024 02:16:03 UTC (3,604 KB)[v2] Fri, 1 Mar 2024 14:09:44 UTC (3,603 KB)"

Traditional methods for predicting buffet onset rely on multiple computational fluid dynamics simulations to assess a series of airfoil flowfields and then apply criteria to them, which is slow and hinders optimization efforts. This article introduces an innovative approach for rapid buffet onset prediction. A machine-learning flowfield prediction model is pre-trained on a large database and then deployed offline to replace simulations in the buffet prediction process for new airfoil designs. Unlike using a model to directly predict buffet onset, the proposed technique offers better visualization capabilities by providing users with intuitive flowfield outputs. It also demonstrates superior generalization ability, evidenced by a 32.5% reduction in average buffet onset prediction error on the testing dataset. The method is utilized to optimize the buffet performance of 11 distinct airfoils within and outside the training dataset. The optimization results are verified with simulations and proved to yield improved samples across all cases. It is affirmed the pre-trained flowfield prediction model can be applied to accelerate aerodynamic shape optimization, while further work still needs to raise its reliability for this safety-critical task.","Tue, 27 Feb 2024 23:37:11 UTC (2,651 KB)"

However, EEG-based language decoding is still in its nascent stages, facing several technical issues such as: 1) Absence of a hybrid strategy that can effectively integrate cross-modality (between EEG and text) self-learning with intra-modality self-reconstruction of EEG features or textual sequences; 2) Under-utilization of large language models (LLMs) to enhance EEG-based language decoding.

Users prefer the most recent version of the dynamically updated content, while the local caches lack knowledge of item popularity and refresh rates. We first explore scenarios with requests arriving at a local cache following a Poisson process, whereby we prove that the optimal policy features a threshold-based structure with updates occurring solely at request arrivals. Leveraging these findings, SwiftCache is proposed as a model-based learning framework for dynamic content caching. The simulation demonstrates near-optimal cost for Poisson process arrivals and strong performance with limited cache sizes. For more general environments, we present a model-free Reinforcement Learning (RL) based caching policy without prior statistical assumptions. The model-based policy performs well compared to the model-free policy when the variance of interarrival times remains moderate. However, as the variance increases, RL slightly outperforms model-based learning at the cost of longer training times, and higher computational resource consumption. Model-based learning's adaptability to environmental changes without retraining positions it as a practical choice for dynamic network environments.

While we perform comparably to the state of the art on CVL, our proposed method yields about 0.21 absolute improvement in terms of mAP on the challenging bilingual ICDAR dataset.","Mon, 26 Feb 2024 21:16:14 UTC (79 KB)"

Whereas extensive research has demonstrated the privacy risks of large language models (LLMs), the RAG technique could potentially reshape the inherent behaviors of LLM generation, posing new privacy issues that are currently under-explored. In this work, we conduct extensive empirical studies with novel attack methods, which demonstrate the vulnerability of RAG systems on leaking the private retrieval database. Despite the new risk brought by RAG on the retrieval data, we further reveal that RAG can mitigate the leakage of the LLMs' training data. Overall, we provide new insights in this paper for privacy protection of retrieval-augmented LLMs, which benefit both LLMs and RAG systems builders.

"140","Using text embedding models and vector databases as text classifiers with the example of medical data","Rishabh Goel","Information Retrieval (cs.IR)","The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) is promising and has found application in numerous fields, but as it often is with the medical field, the bar is typically quite high [5]. In tandem with LLMs, vector embedding models and vector databases provide a robust way of expressing numerous modes of data that are easily digestible by typical machine learning models. Along with the ease of adding information, knowledge, and data to these vector databases, they provide a compelling reason to apply them in numerous fields where the task of retrieving information is typically done by humans. Researchers at Google have developed a clear alternative model, Med-PaLM [6] specifically designed to match a clinician's level of accuracy when it comes to medical knowledge. When training classifiers, and developing models, it is imperative to maintain factuality and reduce bias [4]. Here, we explore the use of vector databases and embedding models as a means of encoding, and classifying text with the example and application in the field of medicine. We show the robustness of these tools depends heavily on the sparsity of the data presented, and even with low amounts of data in the vector database itself, the vector database does a good job at classifying data [9]. Using various LLMs to generate the medical data, we also understand the limitations of the medical knowledge of these models and encourage further expert medical review of our testing data. By using vector databases to classify a clinician's notes on a patient presented with a certain ailment, we understand the limitations of such methods, but also the promise of their prospective use and with continued testing and experimentation, hope to explore a unique use case of vector databases and embedding models.","Wed, 7 Feb 2024 22:15:15 UTC (447 KB)"

However, there is limited research on LLMs specifically addressing oncology-related queries. The primary aim of this research was to develop a specialized language model that demonstrates improved accuracy in providing advice related to oncology. We performed an extensive data collection of online question-answer interactions centered around oncology, sourced from reputable doctor-patient platforms. Following data cleaning and anonymization, a dataset comprising over 180K+ oncology-related conversations was established. The conversations were categorized and meticulously reviewed by field specialists and clinicians to ensure precision. Employing the LLaMA model and other selected open-source datasets, we conducted iterative fine-tuning to enhance the model's proficiency in basic medical conversation and specialized oncology knowledge. We observed a substantial enhancement in the model's understanding of genuine patient inquiries and its reliability in offering oncology-related advice through the utilization of real online question-answer interactions in the fine-tuning process. We release database and models to the research community (this https URL).","Mon, 26 Feb 2024 18:33:13 UTC (722 KB)"

Huang, Jie Fu, Xiang Yue, Wenhu Chen","Computation and Language (cs.CL)","Structured data sources, such as tables, graphs, and databases, are ubiquitous knowledge sources. Despite the demonstrated capabilities of large language models (LLMs) on plain text, their proficiency in interpreting and utilizing structured data remains limited. Our investigation reveals a notable deficiency in LLMs' ability to process structured data, e.g., ChatGPT lags behind state-of-the-art (SoTA) model by an average of 35%. To augment the Structured Knowledge Grounding (SKG) capabilities in LLMs, we have developed a comprehensive instruction tuning dataset comprising 1.1 million examples. Utilizing this dataset, we train a series of models, referred to as StructLM, based on the Code-LLaMA architecture, ranging from 7B to 34B parameters. Our StructLM series surpasses task-specific models on 14 out of 18 evaluated datasets and establishes new SoTA achievements on 7 SKG tasks. Furthermore, StructLM demonstrates exceptional generalization across 6 novel SKG tasks. Contrary to expectations, we observe that scaling model size offers marginal benefits, with StructLM-34B showing only slight improvements over StructLM-7B. This suggests that structured knowledge grounding is still a challenging task and requires more innovative design to push to a new level.","Mon, 26 Feb 2024 15:47:01 UTC (554 KB)[v2] Wed, 28 Feb 2024 14:49:03 UTC (555 KB)"

Most of the existing outfit recommendation systems focus on pairwise item compatibility prediction (using visual and text features) to score an outfit combination having several items, followed by recommendation of top-n outfits or a capsule wardrobe having a collection of outfits based on user's fashion taste. However, none of these consider user's preference of price-range for individual clothing types or an overall shopping budget for a set of items. In this paper, we propose a box recommendation framework - BOXREC - which at first, collects user preferences across different item types (namely, top-wear, bottom-wear and foot-wear) including price-range of each type and a maximum shopping budget for a particular shopping session. It then generates a set of preferred outfits by retrieving all types of preferred items from the database (according to user specified preferences including price-ranges), creates all possible combinations of three preferred items (belonging to distinct item types) and verifies each combination using an outfit scoring framework - BOXREC-OSF. Finally, it provides a box full of fashion items, such that different combinations of the items maximize the number of outfits suitable for an occasion while satisfying maximum shopping budget. Empirical results show superior performance of BOXREC-OSF over the baseline methods.","Mon, 26 Feb 2024 15:34:06 UTC (3,659 KB)"

However, translating Natural Language (NL) into the Graph Query Language (GQL), commonly known as NL2GQL, proves to be challenging due to its inherent complexity and specialized nature. Some approaches have sought to utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) to address analogous tasks like text2SQL. Nevertheless, when it comes to NL2GQL taskson a particular domain, the absence of domain-specific NL-GQL data pairs makes it difficult to establish alignment between LLMs and the graph DB. To address this challenge, we propose a well-defined pipeline. Specifically, we utilize ChatGPT to create NL-GQL data pairs based on the given graph DB with self-instruct. Then, we use the created data to fine-tune LLMs, thereby achieving alignment between LLMs and the graph DB. Additionally, during inference, we propose a method that extracts relevant schema to the queried NL as the input context to guide LLMs for generating accurate GQLs.We evaluate our method on two constructed datasets deriving from graph DBs in finance domain and medicine domain, namely FinGQL and MediGQL. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms a set of baseline methods, with improvements of 5.90 and 6.36 absolute points on EM, and 6.00 and 7.09 absolute points on EX, respectively.","Mon, 26 Feb 2024 13:46:51 UTC (7,972 KB)[v2] Wed, 28 Feb 2024 07:24:19 UTC (7,972 KB)"

Authors' and inventors' names are the key identifiers to carry out these analyses, which however, run up against the issue of disambiguation. By extension identifying inventors who are also academic authors is a non-trivial challenge. We propose a method using the International Patent Classification (IPC) and the IPCCAT API to assess the degree of similarity of patents and papers abstracts of a given inventor, in order to match both types of documents. The method is developed and manually qualified based on three corpora of patents extracted from the international EPO database Espacenet.

Cyclic sieving occurs on a set of objects, a statistic, and a map of order $n$ when the evaluation of the statistic generating function at the $d$th power of the primitive $n$th root of unity equals the number of fixed points under the $d$th power of the map. Of the apparent instances found in our experiment, we prove 34 new instances of the CSP, and conjecture three more. Furthermore, we prove the equidistribution of some statistics and show that some maps have the same orbit structure, thus cyclic sieving holds for more even more pairs of a map and a statistic. The maps which exhibit the CSP include reverse/complement, rotation, Lehmer code rotation, toric promotion, and conjugation by the long cycle, as well as a map constructed by Corteel to swap the number of nestings and crossings, the invert Laguerre heap map, and a map of Alexandersson and Kebede designed to preserve right-to-left minima. Our results show that, contrary to common expectations, actions that exhibit homomesy are not necessarily the best candidates for the CSP, and vice versa.","Mon, 26 Feb 2024 02:30:42 UTC (578 KB)"

We provide an effective and scalable solution to developing CFD+ML algorithms using open source software OpenFOAM and SmartSim. SmartSim provides an Orchestrator that significantly simplifies the programming of CFD+ML algorithms and a Redis database that ensures highly scalable data exchange between ML and CFD clients. We show how to leverage SmartSim to effectively couple different segments of OpenFOAM with ML, including pre/post-processing applications, solvers, function objects, and mesh motion solvers.

"148","Differentially Private Bayesian Persuasion","Yuqi Pan, Zhiwei Steven Wu, Haifeng Xu, Shuran Zheng","Computer Science and Game Theory (cs.GT)","The tension between persuasion and privacy preservation is common in real-world settings. Online platforms should protect the privacy of web users whose data they collect, even as they seek to disclose information about these data to selling advertising spaces. Similarly, hospitals may share patient data to attract research investments with the obligation to preserve patients' privacy. To deal with these issues, we develop a framework to study Bayesian persuasion under differential privacy constraints, where the sender must design an optimal signaling scheme for persuasion while guaranteeing the privacy of each agent's private information in the database. To understand how privacy constraints affect information disclosure, we explore two perspectives within Bayesian persuasion: one views the mechanism as releasing a posterior about the private data, while the other views it as sending an action recommendation. The posterior-based formulation helps consider privacy-utility tradeoffs, quantifying how the tightness of privacy constraints impacts the sender's optimal utility. For any instance in a common utility function family and a wide range of privacy levels, a significant constant utility gap can be found between any two of the three conditions: $\epsilon$-differential privacy constraint, relaxation $(\epsilon,\delta)$-differential privacy constraint, and no privacy constraint. We further geometrically characterize optimal signaling schemes under different types of constraints ($\epsilon$-differential privacy, $(\epsilon,\delta)$-differential privacy and Renyi differential privacy), all of which can be seen as finding concave hulls in constrained posterior regions. Meanwhile, by taking the action-based view of persuasion, we provide polynomial-time algorithms for computing optimal differentially private signaling schemes, as long as a mild homogeneous condition is met.","Sat, 24 Feb 2024 17:26:55 UTC (896 KB)"

The success of the genomics era and recent widespread availability of electronic health records (EHR) has ushered in a new wave of genomic biobanks connected to EHR databases (EHR-linked biobanks). This perspective aims to discuss how race, ethnicity, and genetic ancestry are currently utilized to study common disease variation through genetic association studies. Although genetic ancestry plays a significant role in shaping the genetic landscape underlying disease risk in humans, the overall risk of a disease is caused by a complex combination of environmental, sociocultural, and genetic factors. When using EHR-linked biobanks to interrogate underlying disease etiology, it is also important to be aware of how the biases associated with commonly used descent-associated concepts such as race and ethnicity can propagate to downstream analyses. We intend for this resource to support researchers who perform or analyze genetic association studies in the EHR-linked biobank setting such as those involved in consortium-wide biobanking efforts. We provide background on how race, ethnicity, and genetic ancestry play a role in current association studies, highlight considerations where there is no consensus about best practices, and provide transparency about the current shortcomings.","Sat, 24 Feb 2024 03:08:08 UTC (694 KB)"

The equation of states are obtained using a unified approach of the NS core and inner crust within a fully covariant treatment based on a relativistic mean-field Lagrangian density with density dependent couplings. The posterior distributions are well compatible with the ones obtained by semi-agnostic meta-modelling techniques based on non-relativistic functionals, that span a similar portion of the parameter space in terms of nuclear matter parameters, and we confirm that the hypothesis of a purely nucleonic composition is compatible with all the present observations. We additionally show that present observations do not exclude the existence of very massive neutron stars with mass compatible with the lighter partner of the gravitational event GW190814 measured by the LIGO-Virgo collaboration. Some selected representative models, that respect well all the constraints taken into account in this study, and approximately cover the residual uncertainty in our posterior distributions, will be uploaded in the CompOSE database for use by the community.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 15:31:46 UTC (687 KB)"
