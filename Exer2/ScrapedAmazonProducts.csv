"1","New Balance 1080V12 Running Sneakers","Amazing Arch support! Foot cramping and knee/back pain gone!","David Leavitt","This is the most I've ever spent on a pair of shoes before, and they are worth every penny. The middle of my foot up in the arch used to always cramp up at the end of the day. These shoes have AMAZING arch support! They press and support my arches into place while giving that central muscle the supported stretch that prevents foot cramps!I also dislocated my knee 5 years ago, and have since had residual on and off again knee pain/random swelling that prevent a full range of motion that has also led to lower back/sciatica pain. That pain has been completely resolved since wearing these daily!I was unsure about the color/style looking at them, but after they arrived I also really love the look!Definitely the best shoes I've ever bought. 100 percent a believer now in the importance of investing in your feet","Reviewed in the United States on 22 September 2023","4.6 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"3","New Balance 1080V12 Running Sneakers","Supinator/Underpronator","Amazon Customer","Since 2001, I've had various kinds of foot pain. Usually when I buy a new pair of sneakers, the pain kind of goes away but then returns about 9 months later.I had bought and worn a pair of Hokas and I had a lot of foot pain. A runner looked at the bottom of those shoes and told me that I was supinating/underpronating. I did research on this and eventually found this shoe, the New Balance Fresh Foam X 1080.I have been wearing these shoes for over a year and my foot pain is completely gone! I went ahead and bought another pair 5 months ago (because Murphy's Law is upon finding a product you love, it will be discontinued). I'm just waiting for some kind of foot pain to start before I start wearing the new pair. The first pair are getting pretty worn-looking. I average 1.5 - 2 miles a day of walking and wear sneakers even more since 2020.The sole is pretty flared, probably too flared for any court sports. I don't care if they look dorky, comfort is my priority.","Reviewed in the United States on 26 August 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"6","New Balance 1080V12 Running Sneakers","Excellent shoes, but not for me","Deborah Giampaolo","I bought these because one of my physicians and his nurse are crazy about them for office wear and insisted that I try them.These are well-made, high quality shoes.  They are very light weight and well cushioned.  There is a generous toe box, the width is perfect.  (I have very narrow feet and the normal width is generous and comfortable for me.)  In fact, they're extremely comfortable when I'm standing still.However, the optimal shoe depends on individual needs.  I need neutral shoes and these cause me to overpronate (turn my heel towards the inside of the shoe) and change my gait.  I'm returning them because they don't fit my needs, but they're excellent shoes for the right people.","Reviewed in the United States on 7 August 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"13","New Balance 1080V12 Running Sneakers","Love them may run a half size larger","pat turnipseed","I have Achilles tendinitis and planter fasciitis going on at the same time, lucky me!  I’ve spent a small fortune in shoes that were recommended, not going to say the brand names, they just didn’t work for me.  I’m so blessed to have come across these.  I tried on the v11 and didn’t like the heel digging in me, and took a chance purchasing these on line!  I’m very satisfied. I read way too many reviews, but the good far out weighed the negative.  I wear a 7 in shoes and usually get a 7 1/2 in sneakers but I don’t wear socks.  The toe box is a a smidge longer and I def would order down just a hair! I got a 7 and they’re perfect!!!  I got the black and plan on getting other colors now.  Another important reason I chose v12 is the tongue is not sewn onto the top…. So you can loosen it or tighten it.  I have a small humps on the top of both feet and these feel like heaven.  I HIGHLY recommend the 1080v12, seriously just get them and you won’t be disappointed 😄","Reviewed in the United States on 14 July 2022","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"
"14","New Balance 1080V12 Running Sneakers","Sizing","Amazon Customer","I usually wear  7.5-8 in shoes but in New Balance I always get an 8.5 and it fits great. So that is what I got. The shoes are way too long but are super narrow so I can see what others meant in their reviews. I returned for an wide 8. Hoping they fit. The shoes themselves have great cushion. Much more than my cheaper version of new balance.","Reviewed in the United States on 18 April 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Great fit not too much room width wise in the toe box but did need to go down a half size. I usually wear 9.5 for running and 8.5 in all other shoes but I orderd the 9 and they work great.

My husband ordered the size I normally wear in New Balance however these fit almost a size larger. I was so disappointed to send these back. I could tell they would have been a comfortable shoe, maybe not for high impact sports or running but for a lot walking or standing for long periods of time these would be perfect. I took one star off because the sizing, in my opinion was off.","Reviewed in the United States on 16 February 2023","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"
"20","New Balance 1080V12 Running Sneakers","Walking on clouds!!","Ray","These are exactly what I was looking for!!! I have custom insoles to treat my flat feet and they're pretty thick - it's always been a struggle to find sneakers that have a deep enough heel cup to accommodate my insoles. These sneakers fit them in PERFECTLY. Enough room for my insoles and my heels don't slip out when I walk! They're so fluffy to walk with and obviously well-made. Very good construction, good materials, stretchy laces, and soft mesh. I'm always a 7 in normal shoes but an 8 in New Balance, so these technically fit according to size. I love the Wide versions of New Balance sneakers - soooo comfortable. Don't hesitate and get these immediately! I haven't washed them in the machine yet but I imagine they'll come out good as new when it's time.","Reviewed in the United States on 16 September 2022","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

(Was man bei dem Preis und bei der Marke auch erwarten sollte.Allerdings handelt es sich bei dem Mantelmaterial ausschließlich um Kunstleder.Dieses wiederum reißt an den, dafür prädestinierten stellen, sehr schnell ein.Ich habe den Schuh zunächst reklamiert, weil ich dachte, es sei einfach ein Montagsmodell.Leider musste ich bei dem reklamierten Schuh sehr schnell feststellen, dass es anscheinend ein generelles Problem ist. Der Fakt, dass hier Kunstleder verarbeitet wird, rechtfertigt den Preis dieser Schuhe nicht.

I run a little over 21 miles a week. I had ""settled"" on another brand of minimalist running shoes because they would last from four to five months. However, the quality began to wane badly, and the last pair I purchased didn't even last 2 months. My wife saw an ad for Xero shoes with a 5,000 mile guarantee and suggested them to me.Wow, not only are these the most comfortable shoes I've ever worn, but they swallowed my running route whole and spit out the gravel!

"109","Xero Shoes HFS Lightweight Barefoot Inspired","Great travel shoe","Fit horrible, and not that comfortable","As an airline pilot I am always looking for the perfect travel shoes. Living out of a suitcase for half of the week you quickly figure out how much space a pair of shoes takes up. This is what originally got me into wearing minimalist/barefoot shoes about ten years ago. Since then I have gone back-and-forth between wearing minimalist and traditional shoes. I recently switched to international flying and once again had to address my travel shoe needs. The Xero Shoes Men's HFS shoe fits my travel needs perfectly. Supper comfortable, the laces cinch down perfectly and holds it’s position. I think this design would accommodate a good number foot widths. I love working out in them, using them on long city walks or just kicking back in them on layovers. Normally my travel shoes stay in my suitcase when I’m home but I keep taking them out to workout in because I’m enjoying them so much. (Maybe I should get a second pair 😁) They don’t look too wide in the toe box. We all know how some of these shoes make you look like you have duck feet. As my wife has pointed out about several other shoes I have owned in the past. Xero shoes has done a good job on updating there designs. Not sure I love all their colors. This could be an area they could improve on. I like this shoe so much I recently picked up a pair of Xero Shoes DayLite Hiker Fusion Hiking Boots. Not sure if I’ll use this shoe for my work travels but I’m thinking it will be a good shoe for local hiking and fishing in Colorado. I’ll post a review later. Next on my list will be a pair of  running sandals and an all around travel shoe (I have a big wishlist for this one). I’ll post an update if I find some that I like.

My go to shoes were NB or Brooks and I loved them. Started seeing Xero Shoes pop up on social media and YouTube. I looked them for months and it seemed like a gimmick product. After some time I said ok I am going to try this shoe and see if they meet their hype. In July of this year I ordered the Prio Cross Trainer model. Now their instructions said adjust over a couple of weeks. Well I said hell no and put them to the test right out of the box. I wore them every chance I got for 30 days straight. I found them comfortable right out of the box and I did not experience any foot or leg discomfort during the break period. I began liking them the more I wore them. At day 31 I put my Brooks Adrenaline runners on. Within 15 mins I was aware of how unbalanced I was in that shoe and while walking around in my home said, I can’t wear these any more I have to put my Xero Shoes on. I swear I referred to them specifically. I have since purchased 2 pairs of the HFS model runners and they are my favorite shoe. I wear them every day. In my old shoes at the end of the day I would change to my slides, I literally have these on until I go to bed.

"113","Xero Shoes HFS Lightweight Barefoot Inspired","Smaller than other Xeros!","Steve B","I've had a couple pairs of Xero shoes/boots over the past few years (Mesa Trail shoeand Daylight Hiker boot). Every shoe I've tried from Xero has a great feel right out of the box and fits perfectly. There is zero break in period, and you get a connection with the ground you don't often find in athletic shoes.Unlike the other Xeros I've tried though, the HFS definitely feels small. Here on Amazon the consensus is that they fit true to size, but after trying mine on I noticed immediately that my toes were jammed up in the toe box. I went over to the Xero website where they say the shoe runs smaller than other models. I should have checked that prior to buying them. The manufacturer recommends sizing up one half size. I think that extra space will make it the perfect gym/running shoe. Give them a try. Maybe just order two sizes and send back the one that feels tighter.","Reviewed in the United States on 14 June 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"
"114","Xero Shoes HFS Lightweight Barefoot Inspired","An almost perfect shoe","D. Holland","Xero attempts another running shoe. I switched to this shoe from the Vibram FF V-Run because the latter was giving me blisters. I now run with the Correct Toes toe spacers to keep my toes spread. All in all, I'm happy with the purchase.Pros:- It's a Xero shoe. It's zero drop, has a spacious toe box, a flexible sole, no arch support, and no toe spring. Xero doesn't make pseudo-minimalist shoes: they go all the way.- It's lightweight. Not quite as lightweight as the Lems Primal 2 or the Vibram V-Run, but still very light; lighter than the Prio.- It's pretty! Most athletic shoes (including some Xero shoes) are downright ugly. I love how the Crimson Red color fades into blue in the back. The Glacial Blue looks nice as well. Although it's a running shoe, I would feel comfortable wearing this at the gym or casually.- No blisters or hotspots. Massively better for my feet than the V-Run.- As a running shoe it's competently designed. The sole travels up near the front of the toes, the toe protector extends over the big toe (good for durability), the sole treads are made for the pavement, and there are extra lace holes to make a runner's loop.Cons:- As one other reviewer noted, the fit is poor. It feels loose around the heel. After comparing the shoe to other minimalist shoes (I own a few), the problem is that the shoe does not taper at the midfoot. Not a problem if you tie the laces tight, but it's bad enough to knock a star off the rating.- The insoles slide back as I run. I suspect this is due to the poor fit. I now hold the insoles in place with double sided tape.- Finally, this shoe runs a little small. Maybe go up half a size if you consider purchasing.If Xero ever makes an HFS v2 I hope they fix the fit. Otherwise, it's still a great shoe that I enjoy running in.","Reviewed in the United States on 11 June 2020","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"
"115","Xero Shoes HFS Lightweight Barefoot Inspired","This shoe model is really light and highly flexiable","IamGoldenEagle","I have had this model of shoe for a few months now. I typically wear it once or twice a week while I am out and about running errands .Other than what is written by the designer.Without socks: 1. With or without socks on If you take the insole out, the shoe fits ""True to size"" and is zero-drop.  2. If you were to take the insoles out of both shoes and put them in the opposite shoe upside down(example: left insole upside down in the right shoe) the shoe is true to size and zero-drop.  3. If you trim the insole to the shape of your foot more, you end up reducing the size of the insole heel cup which gives your foot more room in forefoot of the shoe.Otherwise... if you leave the insole as it came from the factory the shoe has some additional cushioning and, due to the heel cup of the insole, a slight heel lift. Due to the slight heel lift the shoe fits tighter at the forefoot.Personally speaking... After wearing the shoe with insoles upside down. I ended up trimming the insole to the shape of my foot more, so that I could leave the shoe as it may have come from the factory.With socks on the overall shoe tightness will depend on whether or not you leave the insole in, how tight you tie the shoe, and how you might lace the shoe.(Side notes: 1. If you do not already know, a basic web search will provide details on different lacing patterns. Including one pattern that allows for a ""Heel lock"" when the shoe is tied. 2. Sanding down the bottom of the insole before putting it in the shoe upside helps the shoe feel softer and massage your feet. )","Reviewed in the United States on 16 June 2021","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

I don't recommend it, though I had no trouble with them.  I used a walking stick.  I did get wet from the top down as you would with any ankle high shoe in six inches of snow.  I figured it was a short hike, they had dried out from my earlier jaunt, so I used them for a reasonably technical nature trail.

I have flat feet and have always struggled with footwear. For a long time, I bought into the traditional support-shoe remedy (marshmallow shoes, as I call them), but the thing with support shoes is that you become dependent on them. It's a crutch, and doesn't really solve the problem.After a year of wearing Xero shoes, I am thrilled to say that I have no problems related to my flat feet anymore. My feet have simply gotten stronger, and I'm never going back to marshmallow shoes.The ONLY issue I had with these shoes is that the sizing is inconsistent with other Xero shoes! I previously had a pair of Prios, which I loved. Got a pair of HFS's after my Prios wore out, and the size was a little different. For the record, my Prios were a 10.5, but I had to get size 11 for the HFS.I'm used to inconsistency across brands, but it was a little weird to have inconsistent sizing within the same brand.

"121","Xero Shoes HFS Lightweight Barefoot Inspired","Amazing Shoes","T","In my opinion, the ideal minimalist shoe should do three things only: protect your feet, hold up as well (or nearly) as normal shoes, and not change the way you run. I have owned and heavily used every kind of barefoot, minimalist, or natural shoe imaginable - FiveFingers, Lems, Altra, Merrell, VivoBarefoot, you name it - and these are literally the only shoes I’ve ever worn that do all three. Oh, and it should look like a normal shoe, not have five separate toes or some other ridiculous looking feature that serves no purpose but to market to “natural” fanatics. I am a physical therapist who spent a lot of time studying gait and running mechanics, so I pay very particular attention to how my foot strikes when I run, and especially how a new shoe modifies my foot strike. All shoes protect my feet, very few minimalist shoes have the durability of normal shoes without adding weight or rigidity, and there are XERO minimalist shoes (see what I did there?) that allow my foot to strike the ground in the exact same way as it does when I run barefoot. I wore these shoes for one week then immediately bought a second pair. Now I wear them when I’m on my feet all day at the hospital, I wear them on road runs, and I wear them on heavy lifting days and dynamic crossfit-style days. They are the best athletic shoe I’ve ever owned, and perform equally well in any setting. Finally!","Reviewed in the United States on 16 April 2021","4.5 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

I'll put a more descriptive review on the size 12's for Men. I ended up giving the 11.5's to my younger brother. He happens to have somewhat smaller feet than I do. It took me a while to figure out my true size as I'm still new and getting used to the barefoot game.As far as my size 12's go - they are perfect! I had dreamt of buying these shoes and making these my first pair of barefoots ever! They feel extremely comfortable - inside & out. The quality of the materials feel like an average sneaker. I love the anatomical toe box as it gives me room to spread my feet. These are my everyday shoes. I will continue to be a customer with the company unless otherwise noted. I'm even part of their 'inner circle.' They're website and company morals are great. I highly recommend you check them out.","Reviewed in the United States on 25 July 2022","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"
"129","Xero Shoes HFS Lightweight Barefoot Inspired","OMFG, these are the most comfortable running shoes I have worn","Winson Lobo","****Update 01Feb2021***230miles later in these babies, a few of those miles in dirt and mud; I had to share pictures. These are my favorite running shoes ever. I do recommend the Prio instead if you split runs between trail and road; but on asphalt.....these are ROYALTY when it comes to comfort, lightness, and looking sexy!Please note.... there is a serious adjustment your body has to make to use not just these, but ANY barefoot shoes. Your feet have forgotten what it is like to be in constant conversation with the ground. I did my retraining by- buying these shoes and wearing them around the house instead of slippers so that my body adjusted to them- did a short jog to ensure that the calves and Achilles can handle the stress- extended my time running with them until it is the ONLY pair I run with nowIt has been a month since I began retraining my feet to barefoot shoes; my calves are still adjusting to the load; but it is more adjustment than pain. Ankle pains, knee pains have all but disappeared.This is MY story and yours will be different. Readjustment is absolutely necessary; so listen to your body. Once done, set your feet free and be amazed with the engineering mechanics your body can do, when it listens to the feet. THANK YOU XERO for a great shoe and I have since bought the Oswego for daily wear and Genesis sandals for when I don't wear shoes","Reviewed in the United States on 5 November 2020","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Have used them jogging on a track, asphalt and even took them on a 5 mile hike with lots of rocks (big and small).The shoes really held up to all these challenges.

"134","Xero Shoes HFS Lightweight Barefoot Inspired","First time barefoot shoes and I like them","Beckwith","I have a birth defect in one of my big toes that's led me to buy extra wide or large shoes all my life. I've had to compromise between more snugness than I'd prefer against that toe, and too much room that results in feet sliding around in the shoes. Over the last few years I've increasingly forgone shoes where I can, hence I took an interest in ""barefoot"" shoes that don't look like a cross between water shoes and gloves.These shoes seem to be the first that give plenty of room for my toes without feeling like my feet are sliding all over. They are truly flexible and seem quite breathable. Finally, they don't look so different as to draw attention yet they are pleasing to the eye. Overall my initial impressions are positive.","Reviewed in the United States on 10 January 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"
"135","Xero Shoes HFS Lightweight Barefoot Inspired","Amazon sent the wrong color... but this shoe rocks for running and casual use.","Carlos Ramos","I started running seriously this year using a mix of traditional 8-10mm drop road and trail shoes with decent results with a mid-foot strike but occasionally caught my heel, typically on descent. I've also been disappointed in how quickly shoe performance changes due to wear. After going out for a barefoot run (and suffering blisters), I expected a minimalist zero drop show would be a good fit. And if these feel as good after 5,000 miles (Xero's sole warranty) as they do now, I may never go back to my other shoes.I've taken the Xero HFS out for several road runs and walk and love the feel and performance improvements. Unlike other shoes, I don't need to lace these too snug to get solid heel fit. The shoes hugs my heel and mid-foot while allowing toes to spread comfortably, a new feeling I find unexpectedly invigorating. These shoes immediately helped me identify problems with my gait. My footing is lighter, smoother, and more relaxed. My training pace and 5K/10K times improved immediately by a full minute reduction. Looking forward to seeing how these perform on trails.","Reviewed in the United States on 2 October 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"
"136","Xero Shoes HFS Lightweight Barefoot Inspired","Beyond my expectations!","Caleb","I was looking for a good flat shoe to work out in when I came across this company. I began to research everything about the Xero shoe and the science behind it made sense so I thought I’d give it a try. WOW!! I was blown away by them from the second I put them on my feet. I took Xeros advice and am still in the transitioning stages of going to a barefoot shoe but I already can tell my feet don’t want to be in another “comfortable” foot coffin. I haven’t ran a whole lot in them because, like I said before, I am still transitioning. But the couple hours a day I wear them and the workouts and small runs I’ve done in them, they have taken my mindset about shoes to a totally new perspective. I will definitely buy more of these to put in rotation, they truly make a difference. As the sizing goes I’m generally in between a 9.5 and a 10 in shoes so I went on Xeros website and they recommended buying a half size larger so I opted for the size 10 and they fit perfect. So if you’re close or in between a size I’d go to the larger of the sizes, your toes will thank you and so will your feet.","Reviewed in the United States on 20 January 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

I've successfully walked and run with them when I visited Philippines for a month and have gotten used to the ""bare foot"" concept. Although I'm still comfortable wearing my Adidas running shoes, I found myself to be wearing my bare foot shoes more often now as I really find them much lighter, comfortable (for bare foot shoes) and lighter/easier to pack on day or extended trips.

"141","Xero Shoes HFS Lightweight Barefoot Inspired","Worth the price","Grant Butler","I've purchased three different types of barefoot shoes off Amazon. The three I got were in the $40 or less price bracket. They did the job, but weren't great. I was concerned about paying this much money on a shoe and stayed away for a few years cause I felt they may not be worth it. I wish I would have bought them sooner. There is a massive difference in the fit, comfort and maneuverability of this shoe compared to the more affordable ones. Also, I appreciate that they are suitable for work and match my wardrobe. Many barefoot shoes look odd or flashy so they don't always blend across multiple looks. I can not attest to the durability over time yet, but these are the most comfortable and versatile barefoot shoes that I've ever worn.","Reviewed in the United States on 30 November 2022","4.5 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

My 4th or 5th HFS pair counting direct from Xero website. And one Daylight Fusion I think it was.Here is key take away. They consistently wear out in about six months. These are definitely for show only. [Edit] [I'm] Not walking over nails or molten metal. Quality has been average, not high end or premium, considering the high cost. When you take into account that all they do is remove all extraneous stuff, the profit margin must be massive versus a USA made New Balance for example.Either you wear out the sole in front or edge breaks/glue comes loose. Same as normal sneakers just these are thinner, so the normal wear makes them useless faster.It really feels bad to buy such throw away/disposable items. But, my feet love them.Wish the massive markup went to better materials but it's literally same as sneakers.

I only put 3 stars for support because that is confusing in this context, as these are minimalist/barefoot shoes and the shoe 'support' is minimal, but that doesn't mean it is bad, it is exactly what I wanted.My ONLY issue is on certain surfaces like tile if you drag your foot across the floor, it makes a very LOUD squeaking sound and can be a little annoying at times.

Very light and breathable, good build quality so far, excellent feel through the sole for what your feet are touching.

"194","ROCKPORT Chranson Brown Black 10 5","Catch these on sale and you will have a deal in your cart.","Louise Taylor","Positives: I got the issues specifically for walking as an exercise, I had injured my Achilles tendon earlier in the year and after consultation with the podiatrist I was advised to get a sturdy shoe for walking. Oddly enough there was no preference given to shoes that were marketed as orthopedic additionally there wasn't any clear brand recommended.This particular shoe by Rockport seemed to meet many of the qualifications. After wearing them I found the following, very sturdy in the ankle, good shock absorption at the heel build into the shoe itself, good shock absorption build into the shoe itself at the forefoot region, external soul stiff and durable, the Shank into the shoe Is solid. And these recommendations matched what I was told by my podiatrist.Negatives: these shoes are a little heavy but that is stated on the website and in advertising. The shoe collar Is too high on both internal and external portions of the shoe and for me it gets uncomfortable I am hoping that this will improve in time. The biggest disappointment is the use of a poor insert from the factory it is flimsy and not significantly padded. It offers no additional arch support that I can feel and it has no shank reinforcement additionally it has no discernible heel cup therefore I removed mine. The shoelaces although they are quite hefty they're not the best at holding a knot.I probably have about 40 miles on these at this point and After removing the factory inserts and replacing them with some Powerstep inserts I'm pretty satisfied.In terms of fit I bought an entire size larger than my normal size secondary to an anticipation to add an additional insert, I wear padded socks and I think my foot is grown. My toes feel great in these shoes and the heel cup is superior to most of my shoes the stability and support excel and that is exactly what I was looking for.I would suggest that everybody in America look for a pair of good walking shoes, it seems that our economy is going to be crushed and I don't know where we'll be able to walk to but it will be nice to have that ability and with these Rockports at least you'll have a chance","Reviewed in Canada on 10 August 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"221","Salomon Mens PRO GTX Black","Great shoes","Blue","They were really stiff for running shoes but with a little break in period probably 3 days for several hours per day they became the best I have ever owned. I was really worried about them as they were making my feet really sore in the ball the arch but I thought let's keep trying and then I got broken in and the sole is stiff so I don't feel every rock but I do feel the terrain I am really pleased with the feel and fit and finish. I would recommend them if you have to the time and patience to break them in, if not I would surely pass, the reviews that talked about the toe box being a little tight well I would say that you haven't seated your heel correctly in the heel cup. I have wide feet and usually wear Keen or New Balance, I was worried about the toe box but after several weeks of runs, I can say that is a non-discussion point. Overall excellent shoes for the job at hand, trail running.","Reviewed in Australia on 1 January 2020","4.5 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Ob auf steinigen Wegen, im Wald oder auf Schotterpisten - die XA Pro 3D Schuhe bieten dank ihrer ausgeklügelten Sohle und des griffigen Profils eine optimale Bodenhaftung und ein stabiles Laufgefühl.Besonders hervorzuheben ist die hochwertige Verarbeitung und das robuste Material. Die Schuhe halten auch bei intensiver Nutzung und hohen Belastungen lange durch und bleiben dabei bequem und atmungsaktiv. Auch die Passform ist sehr gut und lässt sich individuell an den Fuß anpassen.Ein weiterer Pluspunkt ist das schnelle Schnürsystem, welches das An- und Ausziehen der Schuhe sehr erleichtert und auch bei schnellen Läufen ein sicheres Gefühl gibt.Insgesamt bin ich von den Salomon XA Pro 3D Herren Trail Running Schuhen begeistert und kann sie jedem Läufer wärmstens empfehlen.

"227","Salomon Mens PRO GTX Black","Great general purpose hiking shoe","Kattenfindus","Got a pair of these XA PRO 3D GTXs to complement my old GTX X Ultra 3s. These primarily differ in that they have a rigid plastic arch plate.Objectively, this makes them easier to use for long trail hikes over rocky ground but on the flip side they do take a bit of time to wear in and mold to the foot (the X Utras fit like a glove pretty much from day 1).The sole tread seems similar to the X Utras, in that it's quite soft so they do wear. (the X Ultra 4's look like they've got a longer lasting tread pattern). I reckon I'll get maybe 250-300kms out of them by the time the lugs under the sole are worn pretty low. I'd have liked Salomon to use a slightly harder compound: the uppers are still going strong but the soles are dying.Both mine are GTX and it's a nice to have when it's wet. I don't have any issues using them in the heat. The autolacing system works great and I find them very comfortable, even if you have to tighten them every couple of hours. You have to do that with laces too, so the convienience is great.All in all these are both great trail hiking shoes and light enough to run with for shorter distances. If you are carrying serious weight you may want something with a hardered tread compound as the do wear fairly quickly. The flip side of this is they provide sure footed grip on most surfaces, even in the wet.Recommended, I'd give them 4.6 stars,  dropping the 0.4 points because I wish they had a little more durable (longer lasting) soles, but well worth it if you can get them at a discounted price.","Reviewed in Sweden on 24 July 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"230","Salomon Mens PRO GTX Black","Great pair of shoes!","AFP","I had my first run in with Salomon products in Europe when I decided to try skiing out. Everything was a rental from the boots (Salomon SX91, the bindings were Marker and the skis were K2) The boots fit like a glove and there were no pressure points at all on my feet.Forward to 2024, I ordered these  XA PRO 3D Gore-Tex Trail Running Shoes to try on because the brand I was going with for my duty footwear kept changing their design and they finally ran out of the model that I liked so I figured I'd try these out. Amazon has this ""try before you buy"" program so I decided to go that route.These shoes are designed for on-road and off-road as they have an aggressive lug sole that is comfortable and a reassuring grip. The shoe is built well and has a comfortable sole. The lacing system is different and it didn't take long for me to like the speed lacing system that Salomon uses for their shoes.These shoes do need a bit of a break-in, about three days.I was impressed with this pair that I bought another pair to switch up for my uniform.","Reviewed in Spain on 22 December 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

(That was after 8 or so months of heavy duty wear and tear) They were perfectly waterproof up until then and still are for 2 hours, then the water starts to get in.

"238","Salomon Mens PRO GTX Black","Satisfied Customer","Corey Benoit","Bought the Trail Runners 2 weeks ago. I have flat feet and one foot is a little larger than the other. I have a hard time finding comfortable shoes. I wear size 13 and I ordered the 13M. The length is perfect. My heals slip a little but I don’t see that as a problem. I don’t even notice it any more. My toes have plenty of room to move. The first day I wore them I removed the insole and the underside was wet to the touch as well as the inside  bottom of the sole. I replaced the factory insole with a Dr Scholls insole. So far there is no wetness. I’m planning on using these shoes for my 500 mile Camino walk. I’m sure at the end of a days hike my feet will be hot and damp. I did part of the Camino 2 years ago (same shoe but an earlier version) and my size 12 was a little to small but I managed. No blisters or any other problems.I’ve heard others say the sides of the shoe is to high and hits the ankle. The shoe is a little higher but it has not caused a problem for me. In fact I like the higher sides. Better support.The shoe is a little hot but that is a good thing when the  temperature is cooler. The Dr Scholls insole seems to have helped with the heat. I don’t notice it now as I did with the factory insole.The soles are a knoby verses the soles on my previous pair. See photo. Good grip.I really like the shoe lace. I’ve never seen this kind before. It’s a very thin one piece nylon lace. No tying. Just pull them up tight and adjust the gripper down. Very nice. I don’t know what you’d do if they broke.Another comment was that they squeak when you walk. They did squeak when they first came out of the box but no more squeaking once you’ve used them.I have not used them in wet conditions but I have faith they will keep my feet dry. I can’t wait to get on the Camino. The trail runners feel and fit great.","Reviewed in Canada on 5 January 2019","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"368","KEEN Targhee II Waterproof Hiking","Goldilocks Boots","ゆーすけ","Not to much, not too little, just right! I needed to replace my old worn out boots and found the Keen Targhee II. I wasn't 100% sold on the ""mid"" height until they arrived and i tried then on. The lacing system on the Targhee is really nice, it locks your heel in place and only improves as the boot wears in. Speaking of wearing in, these boots come relatively comfortable right out of the box.I spent 5 days tramping though heavy woods and swamps in 40 to 70 degree weather. I encountered wet brush, mud, rocks and thick brush. The boots held up great and treated my feet very well. The first thing i noticed as i entered the woods was the very apparent heel support, my heels felt very settled in these boots and never once slipped or rubbed. At the same time the footbed of the heel felt very protected while walking yet the forefoot remained supple and transferred the feel of the surfaces i was walking on to the ball of my foot very nicely. This is great when edging along rock ledges or waking across logs. The toe box on the Targhee's may feel bigger than your last pair of boots when you first slip them on but i think this design is wonderful because as your foot flattens out or grows on long hikes your toes require just a bit more room than normal.The mid height turned out to be very nice and allowed me to wear lower socks making my feet feel cooler in these boots. Although as with any boot, if you do plan on walking in wet foliage it is a good idea to wear a pair of leg gators to keep the rain from running down your legs and into your boots. Speaking of water the Keen Dry kept my boots nice and dry though swamp crossings and spring rains. As with any waterproof boot i did get some perspiration build up but that was easily dried out at the end of the day. If your looking for a new pair of boots Give the Targhee's a try you just might find a new favorite boot like i did.","Reviewed in Japan on 8 March 2020","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

I have wide, size 12 feet and always look for foot-shaped shoes with good support; these are perfect!","Reviewed in Japan on 20 March 2016","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"392","KEEN Targhee II Waterproof Hiking","Light, versatile, incredibly comfortable GENERAL PURPOSE hiker- personal preference and a summary","Cameron","The Keen Targhee II men's waterproof mid hikers are surprisingly light and extraordinarily comfortable, right out of the box. The lengthy lace pattern starts right where the toe box meets the boot body and extends well up the ankle, allowing for a fairly custom fit (or for thick/thin sock versatility).  Personally, I would prefer one more set of lugs for the laces to make the fit even more adjustable, but that is subjective and the lace configuration works fine. The rubber soles are a bit slick when new, but once roughed up, are grippy and confidence-instilling.  I don't know if they will hold up as well as the Vibram compounds I have on other boots, but so far, so good.  The 4mm lug pattern is aggressive, but not to the point that you're digging walnuts and rodents out of them at the end of the day.  The EVA midsole is solid but has some springy give to it.  My feet felt stable, yet flexible.  The compound does feel soft so durability may be sacrificed for comfort.  Rock-hoppers might see some early damage.  The ESS shank is also rigid but has enough give for us high-arched folks to feel okay.  Because of my tall feet, I had intended to replace the dual-density footbeds or swap for my super-comfy Salewa beds, but the factory pads actually feel pretty good so I will give them a solid run.The fabric, leather, and ""other"" materials are all well-conceived and well-used.  I am hard on boots and prefer few metal and plastic parts that can bend or break.  The Targhee II's deliver with only two plastic lugs at the ankle and reinforced nylon loop/webbing elsewhere.  The seam and gusset construction is all smart and highly-functional. Linings are soft and, so far, durable.  Even the laces are really nice-  typical Keen with an almost abrasive quality to them that helps them lock into lugs and stay tied.If aesthetics are part of your hiking musts, the s***ake/brindle combo is about as benign as it gets-  brown and light brown with dark brown accents and a splash of black.  Color, aside from the reflective stitching, comes from the yellow lettering on KEEN and WATERPROOF labels-  not exactly flashy (save that for your speed hikers!).  Touching on the waterproof claim-  so far so yep.  I haven't spent significant time standing in water up to the collars, but showers and serious puddle stomping-  bone dry piggies!  I do not engage in significant water-crossing so I do not have a need for more rigorous wet-testing.  If, however, anything develops from testing by field happenstance, I will update my review.In summary:  If you want a light, versatile, all-day hiker that will get you up the rocks, through the brush, and over the squishy stuff (rain or shine), I cannot imagine finding a better boot for under $200.  Pictures are from one of 6 full days (virtually sun up to sun down) hiking/trekking through Ireland in my Targhees with confidence instilling footing, no wet socks, and exceptional comfort.  Keep in mind-  these are a general-purpose hiking option.  They are not designed to be task-specific.  If you spend 90% of your time in mud, in sand, on rocks, in snow, etc, get specific gear.  If you want an excellent all-purpose option that will handle a reasonable amount of terrain/weather, get 'em.A couple of notes:  -  These boots are warm on warm days.  They do not breathe tremendously well, but you only get so much breathability out of breathable waterproof linings/boots; especially those that employ lots of leather.  -  Although some other Keens I own run maybe a 1/4 size small, and notes on Amazon's storefront advise ordering 1/2 size larger, the Targhee II's I got are accurate in length.  I ordered my regular size expecting them to start out snug, and break in for a better ""my feet"" fit, but they are a perfect, true 10.5 for me.  In fact, since in most boots, I wish they made a 10.75, the Targhee II slightly wider than D girth (my opinion) allows my foot to fill the boot comfortably, with substantial side-to-side adjustability.  I can  slack the laces for a less constricting experience, or snug them down for more serious terrain and the fit responds perfectly.","Reviewed in Australia on 1 September 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"399","KEEN Targhee II Waterproof Hiking","Comfortable, Quality, Smart Design.","Paul- Labby companion","Five stars so far..I bought a full size up from my normal size 6 (yes, I am a really small guy) because I wanted room for thick wool socks for a hiking trip. I would have bought a 6.5 size but not available so jumped to 7's.The most hiking I do these days is across the parking lot at work and up 3 flights of stairs to my desk so the padding is a must for my soft soles. I hate buying shoes because they never have my size. My feet are very wide and I have no arches which makes finding the right fit even harder.Usually it takes several painful days for me to break in shoes.These Keen Targhees are ""amazing"" and I am not exaggerating. They were comfortable from the moment I put them on. I had on thin socks so I cinched the laces, they snugged up nice and tight and fit great. I put on extra thick wool socks and loosened the laces and they still fit great.Today, I wore thick Merino wool socks out in 90 degree humid Missouri weather and my feet sweated less than wearing cotton dress socks and leather loafers in the office. I am not kidding.Another thing, Usually when you get a pair of shoes and try them on, even if they feel good at first, you'll usually find a ""hotspot"" that seems like something wasn't sewn right and will start to rub and you think, ""Well, I'll just have to put up with it until my foot toughens up in that spot. There has been none of that with these shoes.So, I've worn these every day for a week or so and here's my take so far.- Mid-weight and comfortable out the box.-The lacing system allows for a wide variety of fits in a singe shoe and is very sturdy. It incorporates a strap that goes around your heel that allows you to tighten the heel fit so your shoe doesn't rub up and down on your heel when walking. Nice touch.-While water proof, these shoes are breathable and my feet have stayed nearly dry.-The inner-sole is removeable and washable and adds great padding.-The arch support is just right. Some shoes go way over the top with it which can actually put too much pressure on your arch and wind up hurting. These are a sensible mid-range that should work well with many foot arch types.-The fully covered rubber toe cap is legit. It is flexible but seems substantial enough to protect the front end from wear and tear and should extend the life of the shoe. It is NOT steel toe and you are not going to scale any vertical rock faces wearing these.-I don't care about brand names or if my gear matches and even less about fashion but have to say these have a bit of style to them. I've been wearing them with dress slack to work to break them in and have actually gotten a couple compliments.-The soles are flexible but don't seem so thin that you'll feel every little rock you step on.-The fabric loops for the laces are reflective so I would not recommend these for ninjas.Obiviously these are first impressions. I can't say these are the best shoes ever (yet) because I havent put them to the test. That's next week in Colorado if we can find a trail that hasn't gotten blown out by streams flooded by snow melt. But, so far, these shoes have proven to be quality and my admiration for  comfortability and attention to design has grown immensely.Update 07/15/2015:The boots were great. They grip well on rocks and uneven terrain. My feet did not blister! :) I wore extra thick merino wool sock wich helped but I attribute it to design as well. My brother had a pair of Vasque boots which have a narrower toe configuration and his toes blistered fairly quick. I'm really happy with this purchase and highly recommend these boots.","Reviewed in Germany on 5 January 2024","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

They hurt my feet and legs so bad the first day, and I figured it was becausei needed to break them in. But I've had these for almost a month now and they're hurting my legs, feet and ankles. I think it's because these things have thick soles at the heel and thickness reduces towards the toes. So I basically feel like I'm walking on high heels- just tiptoeing everywhere.

La marca è una garanzia, sono alto 1.75 e peso 75 kg e ho acquistato una M e mi sta come deve andare.CALZANO LARGHI, se volete che il prodotto vi stia slim prendete una taglia in meno e data l'elasticità aderirà senza problemi, ma sono joggers ed è normale calzino larghi quindi se cercate un prodotto aderente vi consiglio di optare per altre soluzioni.Sono caldi quindi non adatti al periodo estivo.In conclusione li consiglio sicuramente per alestra o altre attività dato che sono estremamente comodi, inoltre nel periodo invernale mantengono il calore senza far sudare eccessivamente.

Ich glaube, dass hier Nike die Zusammensetzung beziehungsweise die Qualität geändert hat und es nicht eine Fälschung ist. Weil diese angeschaute Qualität gibt es nur noch bei Nike zu kaufen.

This is the same as the right side photo - it has citric acid as the second last ingredient. The one being sold in the image and on the left is the older cetaphil (with no dermatologist tested stamp) and has no citric acid but tocopheral and tocopheryl acetate.

Just get the one that's cheapest at the time you need it. In comparison to E45 (which I haven't use), E45 is more expensive per gram and suspect it will be thicker too.

I get dry patches on my face and other areas, which are normally alleviated by other sensitive skin moisturisers. However, when I applied this to my face, the skin stung and after a while, it felt even drier and tighter than before I applied the cream. At first, I thought I may have walked into a cloud of hairspray or perfume while out and about, which has a similar effect, but after a couple of days of not going near any shops and my skin still feeling bad, I wondered if it was the cream. I went back to using a different moisturiser I am familiar with, and the symptoms disappeared very quickly. Regrettably, as I waited until I had finished an 'in-use' tube before I started this one, I missed the return window by two days, otherwise it would have been sent back as not fit for purpose.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 26 March 2018","4.5 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Can be used daily ; gives an unmatched sense of having ""scrubbed down"" when you need it. Perfect for sensitive skin prone to breakouts and redness (hypoallergenic and non-comedogenic).The tube in itself is sturdy and compact.Consistency - watery gel with mild granulations.Amount required - very, very little (which makes the price worth it. It'll last you for ages.)Scent - clean and refreshing, one of the main things that attracted me.Lather - not bubbly, but obvious.Washing off - wash off at least twice to remove the residue. In my experience, that's how much is required.Feel - a thorough cleanse. Skin may feel a little tight subsequently, but that's the case with most soaps or facewashes.","Reviewed in India on 9 May 2020","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Avevo dato per scontato che l'avesse, come su tutti i modelli precedenti, ma su questo modello si sono divertiti a prendere in giro i clienti.Questa enorme mancanza crea molti problemi nell'uso di tantissime app e tanti problemi di sicurezza, impossibile usare LastPass, PosteID, app Banche, app gestionali, e tante altre, bisogna ricordare tutti i codici, come fossimo nei primi anni 2000.....Oltre al dettaglio che ha la presa USB C e non danno il caricatore incluso. Quindi noi clienti sempre Apple dobbiamo andare a comprare un caricatore e buttare i mille cavi e caricatori che abbiamo...aumentiamo gli sprechi...Apple...mai più...","Reviewed in Italy on 8 August 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"1701","Google-GHL1X-Unlocked-Smartphone-Charcoal","de los pixel la mejor relacion calidad/precio","anne","Es un pixel, pero el mas barato del mercado hoy.  Lo he comprado para escapar del software que otros fabricantes te imponen, para mi merece la pena . Vengo de un POCO  y me esta  costando un poco acostumbrarme a encontrar las cosas.Estoy usando dos lineas , una con sim normal y la otra con Esim, funciona perfectamente pero no da facilidades para cambiar los datos de que sim usas. Tener dos lineas es una cosa habitual en china pero no en America  por lo que no da facilidades para un segundo espacio como si daba MIUI.Lo mejor,  estoy enamorado del filtro de llamadas, creo que hoy aun es exclusivo de  los pixel , a trolear a los vendedores, solo por ello me ha merecido la pena.La gran pega es el detector de huellas en la pantalla , no entiendo porque lo han puesto ahí, acaba fallando si pones  protectores de pantalla  incluso el mas caro . ¿ es ese el objetivo? ¿que no pongas protector?La cámara es alucinante.Si buscas un móvil pequeño , no creo que encuentres nada mas pequeño, 6.1 pulgadas.Lo peor es la falta  personalización de accesos directos, por ejemplo no encuentro un widget para acceder directamente al wifi  o cambiar de sim o...todo pasa por ir a configuración  .","Reviewed in Australia on 13 February 2024","4.2 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Es la primera vez que utilizo el asistente Hey Google: funciona bien y es muy práctico.

"1704","Google-GHL1X-Unlocked-Smartphone-Charcoal","Google Pixel 7A… Ne sentivamo davvero il bisogno?","Ronny","Durante l’evento Goggle I/O, il colosso di Mountain View ha presentato insieme al nuovo tablet, al pixel fold ed a tanta, ma davvero tanta AI il nuovo medio gamma, ovvero il Pixel 7A.Il prezzo di listino al momento del lancio è di 509 € ed al momento, per un periodo di tempo limitato, acquistandolo riceverete in omaggio un paio di Google Pixel Buds A-Series, i nuovi auricolari wireless economici di Google.Per essere un dispositivo di fascia media dobbiamo però riconoscere acquisto smartphone alcune caratteristiche che solitamente si trova sì top di gamma, il processore infatti è il Tensor G2, lo stesso con cui è equipaggiato il suo fratello maggiore, anche il comparto fotografico è di tutto rispetto, così come il display Oled, che ha le stesse identiche caratteristiche di quello montato sul Pixel 7, ma soltanto leggermente più piccolo.E questa non è sicuramente l'unica caratteristica che condividono, basta infatti confrontare le due schede tecniche prendersi subito conto che le caratteristiche in comune tra i due smartphone sono davvero tante, proprio per questo motivo la domanda che mi sono posto è: sentivamo davvero il bisogno di questo Google Pixel 7A?Per poter rispondere a questa domanda devo prima raccontarvi un po’ la mia esperienza con questo dispositivo, poi alla fine tirerò le somme e trarrò le mie conclusioni, che ci tengo fin da ora specificare sono assolutamente soggettive.Come ho già detto in precedenza molte caratteristiche di questi due smartphone sono assolutamente identiche, al punto di renderli quasi indistinguibili tra loro. Il pannello OLED e della stessa tipologia, stessa risoluzione, stessa frequenza di aggiornamento, Anche la memoria RAM è dello stesso tipo, oltre che dello stesso taglio essendo entrambi dotati 8GB; stessa cosa per il processore, uguale per entrambi i dispositivi, per quanto riguarda lo spazio di archiviazione, entrambi dispongono di 128GB, Ehi anche se per il pixel 7 è disponibile anche il taglio da 256GB.Entrambi dispongono di uno slot per nano SIM ed offrono la possibilità di configurare una eSim. Se a livello di connettività Wi-Fi non troviamo differenze, Il Bluetooth fa invece un bel balzo in avanti offrendo il nuovo standard 5.3 rispetto al 5.1 del suo rivale.Come detto in precedenza i due display, aldilà della lieve differenza di dimensioni ( 6,3"" Pixel 7 e 6,1"" Pixel 7A) sono praticamente identici, quello che cambi e non poco è il vetro, e questa volta ad avere la meglio è il modello più vecchio con il suo Corning Gorilla Glass Victus, l’attuale modello di punta, mentre sul 7A troviamo un Corning Gorilla Glass 3 vecchio di ben tre generazioni.Per quanto riguarda il comparto camere, sulla carta vince leggermente il 7A, anche se poi, le foto appaiono pressoché uguali. Ottima la ricarica Wireless del nuovo smartphone, veloce ed affidabile.La to software non cambia nulla, la sensazione è quella di avere tra le mani lo stesso smartphone, unica differenza, entrambi avranno 5 anni di aggiornamenti garantiti, ma il nuovo 7A, per una mera questione “anagrafica” avrà circa otto mesi di vita in più in questo senso. Venendo al prezzo, il prezzo di listino di 509€ del Pixel 7A, soprattutto nell’attuale bundle promozionale in cui sono comprese le Pixel Buds A-Series, risulta decisamente più basso rispetto al prezzo di listino del Pixel 7 di 649€…Essendo però uscito ormai da qualche mese, si trovano molte offerte e lo street price si aggira mediamente sui 525€, quindi molto vicino al nuovo modello.Alla luce di tutte queste considerazioni, essendo appunto i due smartphone molto simili, è giunta l’ora di provare a dare una risposta alla domanda iniziale…SENTIVAMO DAVVERO IL BISOGNO DI QUESTO PIXEL 7A?La risposta non è semplice e si potrebbe riassumere con un NI… in questo preciso istante, se siete intenzionati ad acquistare uno di questi due dispositivi, secondo me fareste bene a prendere il nuovo 7A, infatti allo stesso prezzo avrete anche le buds in omaggio ed avrete tra le mani un telefono di qualche mese più nuovo e di conseguenza più duraturo nel tempo.Finita la promozione, secondo me, se il prezzo del 7A non calerà di almeno 80/100€ questo telefono non troverà il suo spazio nel mercato e la mia scelta ricadrebbe allora  sul Pixel 7 che offre schermo leggermente più grande e con cornice più snella, materiali migliori.In ogni caso si tratta di due ottimi telefoni e quello che farà la differenza per chi è intenzionato ad acquistare uno o l’altro sarà soltanto il prezzo.Allego alla recensione qualche foto del dispositivo e della sua dotazione di vendita, oltre ad alcune foto scattate con lo smartphone in condizioni differenti.Spero che queste mie riflessioni possano esservi utili nella scelta del dispositivo più adatto alle vostre esigenze.","Reviewed in France on 12 February 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Gli aggiornamenti sono frequenti.- Facilità di utilizzo, software semplice e intuitivo, provo di inutili ""cinesate"". Si sblocca facilmente anche tenendo installato un vetro di protezione sullo schermo. Ha lo sblocco facciale. Tantissime applicazioni utili made in Google compreso l'assistente virtuale di Google ""Hey Google"".- Rapporto qualità prezzo. Rispetto ai concorrenti almeno nella fascia media per ora non c'è storia, soprattutto ora che c'è la promozione della A-Buds.- Il design lo trovo molto bello, la scocca posterioriore è semplice ma assolutamente riconoscibile, soprattutto per quanto riguarda la fascia che accoglie le fotocamere.- Il comparto fotocamera e l'elaborazione delle foto è da top di gamma. Utilissima la funzione ""gomme magica"" che permette di cancellare elementi nelle foto in modo convincente, l'hanno migliorata molto nel tempo.- Lo schermo è passato dai 60 hz del Google Pixel 6A ai 90hz per di più con la funzione adattiva per migliorare le prestazioni della batteria(esistonovarie funzioni per migliorare la durata della batteria).DIFETTI- La durata della batteria è rimasta limitata soprattutto con un uso intensivo.- La velocità di ricarica purtroppo rimane un tasto dolente anche in questa nuova versione del Google Pixel. Se tendete a dimenticarvi di caricarlo durante la notte potreste avere dei problemi durante il giorno.- Il caricatore 30W di Google non è incluso nella confezione, preparatevi quindi a spendere ulteriori 30 euro.- Nessuna pellicola preinstallata sullo schermo.Nonostante i difetti per ora tendo a promuovere questo piccolo gioiello di tecnologia.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 31 December 2023","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"1715","Google-GHL1X-Unlocked-Smartphone-Charcoal","⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐","pavel.p","Das Pixel 7a ist ein wirklich sehr gutes Smartphone, günstig und kann trotzdem alles. Es fühlt sich wie ein Top Smartphone (iPhone Pro) an. Daher 10 Sterne 👍.Ich hatte vorher ein Jahr lang ein iPhone Mini 13 mit Apple Care+ (fast 1000€). Nach einem Jahr hatte der Akku nur noch weniger als 90%. Wenn man es ohne Apple Care austauschen muss, ist es unverschämt teuer. Ich habe es verkauft. Das Display hatte nur 60 Hz. Nur die Software von Apple ist sehr gut. Als Entwickler ist ein Apple jedoch weniger geeignet, da man für eigene Apps 100€ pro Jahr zahlen muss und ohne Mac nicht einfach installieren kann. Bei Google ist es natürlich kostenlos und mit fast jedem PC (auch Chromebook) möglich.Was ganz wichtig ist. Smartphones sollten wieder austauschbare Akkus bekommen (So wie damals bei Nokia) und auch ein Display darf keine 250€ kosten! Ich hoffe das hier die EU weitere Maßnahmen unternimmt, damit Hersteller wieder austauschbare Akkus einbauen müssen...oder der Kunde den Akku günstig und einfach austauschen kann. Alte Smartphones könnten noch viel länger benutzt werden, wenn man Akkus einfach und günstig tauschen könnte und es mindestens 10 Jahre Sicherheitsupdates geben würde. Bei Google gibt es immerhin 5 Jahre Updates.Beim Pixel kostet ein originales Display ca. 100€ und der Akku 40€. Andere Hersteller sollten dies auch anbieten. Bei Apple geht es zwar in den USA, die Preise in Deutschland werden aber bestimmt nicht billig.Wer kauft sich denn ein tolles Samsung Flip für 1000€ und schickt es dann ein, wenn der Akku getauscht werden muss?Wer aktuell wirklich sparen möchte, aber trotzdem ein sehr gutes Smartphone möchte, sollte sich ein Google Pixel kaufen.+ günstiger Preis+ schnelle Updates von Google (wahrscheinlich morgen schon Android 14) und regelmäßig Sicherheits- und Feature-Updates (neue Funktionen)+ Akkulaufzeit und kabelloses laden (wird nicht heiß und lädt bis zum Wecker langsam vollständig auf)+ Kamera+ kostengünstige Reperatur mit original Ersatzteilen (Akku ca. 40€) möglich+ 90 Hz Display+ sehr gute FeaturesBei einem Wechsel werden alle Daten (auch WhatsApp) übertragen.Für 500€ bekommt man von Apple nur das SE mit sehr schlechtem Display und Akku 😀Wer Probleme mit dem Fingerprint Sensor hat, sollte den Finger einmal ohne Folie und dann mit Folie scannen. Nicht jede Folie ist kompatibel und man muss unter Display den Displayschutzmodus aktivieren.

Nell'utilizzo di tutti i giorni non trovo nessuna differenza di velocità e fluidità (non sono uno smanettone, parliamo di messaggi, social, foto e qualche ricerca web ), anzi, si collega 1 volta si e 3 no all'auto come al wifi di casa e devo ripetere l'operazione manualmente, la batteria del vecchio S10 mi portava a sera senza mai problemi ( anche nell'ultimo periodo ) il nuovo 7a devo obbligatoriamente ricaricarlo a metà pomeriggio e la ricarica e più lenta, manca il jack cuffie e per collegare le cuffie bluetooth solito problema di connessione mancata o lenta più del S10.Il tema del Cell e poco personalizzabile e la barra di ricerca come il widget del calendario sono molto scomodi e a mio parere brutti da vedere.Il peggio, insieme alla durata della batteria e sicuramente lo schermo, che nonostante sia superiore a quello del mio vecchio S10 ( e si vede ) funziona anch'esso male inventando tocchi che nn ci sono, questo per fortuna succede raramente ma dopo più di un mese posso dire che succede e soprattutto dalla schermata home.Per chi come me arriva da quel telefono SCONDIGLIO IL PASSAGGIO sarebbe un clamoroso passaggio all'indietro.399€ pixel 7a poco più di 200€ ora S10 !!!Per correttezza spendo due parole sulla fotocamera che è di gran lunga migliore del S10 e funziona bene.Spero sia utile a qualcuno e ricordo di non essere un gran intenditore della materia e di essermi basato solo sul mio utilizzo giornaliero.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 19 October 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"1727","Google-GHL1X-Unlocked-Smartphone-Charcoal","Per Google non ci siamo ancora.","AmazonDani","Preso da l'euforia di questo ""piccolo"" di casa Google ho provveduto a l'acquisto, ora vi dirò la mia esperienza.✅ I PRO:✅ Ergonomia davvero ottima, sia come peso sia come dimensioni, sicuramente non è un campione di ottimizzazione sulle cornici c'è da lavorare.✅ Display a 90Hz che mi ha convinto, anche in queste giornate d'agosto dove il sole sta dando il meglio di sé, questo display lo trovo comunque adeguato, il tutto si muove in maniera piacevole e anche il touch è molto preciso quasi predittivo alle volte.✅ Software ottimo, un esperienza fluida e senza compromessi, un po' come iOS di Apple.Arrivando proprio da quest'ultimo temevo di trovarmi spaesato, invece alla fine ci si trova subito a famigliarizzare con un ottima interfaccia, essenziale ma ricca di chicche utilissime nella vita di tutti giorni, piccole gecsture che semplificano di molto l'uso quotidiano.Per finire c'è la garanzia d'aggiornamento Google che lo colloca al vertice della categoria Android.✅ Fotocamera, sebbene gli obbiettivi siano più dotati rispetto a Pixel 7, soffrono però il peso dell'età, non sono l'ultimo ritrovato tecnologico, però gli scatti di questo smartphone sono mozzafiato, la Gcam e l'intelligenza artificiale fanno miracoli! Anche l'editing post produzione è molto ampio, ci sono diverse implementazioni che si possono usare per migliorare lo scatto finito.Anche i video mi hanno colpito positivamente, si arriva fino al 4k a 60 FPS, niente male per un prodotto di questa fascia.✅ il G-Tensor, processore che lavora molto su l'intelligenza artificiale, non è un fulmine di guerra, ma garantisce un prodotto sempre pronto e reattivo.✅ Motore della vibrazione fantastico! Direi perfetto, pochi smartphone me lo hanno fatto apprezzare come lui.❌I CONTRO:❌ Tornando sulla fotocamera elogiata in precedenza, presenta alcune ombre, io posso segnalare che la stabilità nei video è il tallone d'Achille di questo prodotto, a volte la registrazione risulta scattosa e tende un po' a bruciare la scena in condizioni di scarsa luminosità.Lo stesso vale per le foto in notturna, occorre regolare un po' le luci e giocare di correzioni se si vuole uno scatto ricco di dettagli, il punta e scatta a volte non regala prodotti degni di nota.❌ Non adatto al Gaming, questo è un aspetto che io reputo poco fondamentale, ma va'detto che il G Tensor non è un mostro di prestazione, quindi alcuni giochi gireranno castrati, anche se per i giochini arcade che faccio io non ho mai notato rallentamenti, nemmeno dopo lunghe sessioni.❌ Temperature non proprio eccezionali, il prodotto tende a scaldare in lunghe sessioni d' uso, questo compromette anche il drenaggio della batteria, gli aggiornamenti lo hanno migliorato ma il problema in questi giorni si fa sentire parecchio.❌ Il display passa dai 60 ai 90Hz, non ha vie intermedie, anche questo compromette l'usura della batteria, altro aspetto le cornici sono un po' anacronistiche, si poteva fare molto meglio come ottimizzazione dei bordi.❌ Audio un po' basso, mentre l'audio in chiamata mi ha soddisfatto, anche quello in vivavoce non mi dispiace, quello multimediale non mi fa impazzire, non distorce il suono ma lo trovo un po' privo di bassi, nulla di grave però si poteva fare qualcosa di più.❌ Ricarica lenta, questo non sarebbe un grande problema se solo la batteria fosse più prestante!Spesso per affrontare la serata occorre una ricarica prima di cena, ma i tempi di ricarica non sono celeri, quindi va'tenuto in considerazione soprattutto se non ci si può fermare per una carica intermedia.La ricarica wireless fa ridere 😂 quella non calcolare la nemmeno, mci mette una vita a completare una carica completa.❌ Batteria! Tanto discussa e si a me non ha soddisfatto! Io con il telefono ci lavoro molto, questa si è dimostrata davvero inadeguata, non ho mai raggiunto il fine giornata, spesso alle 16 serviva una ricarica veloce, altrimenti la serata non lo vede nemmeno.❌ Touch-Id non è sempre fulmineo, con le pellicole applicate spesso non legge il sensoreAnche le mani secche non aiutano, insomma c'è ancora da lavorare, nulla a che vedere con i sensori della concorrenza.Conclusione, ho optato dopo una settimana di passare al Pixel 7 normale, questo lo reso un po' a malincuore perché il formato mi piace e i compromessi sono onesti, ma per me la batteria è un aspetto basilare, spero che i prossimi aggiornamenti lo possano rendere un prodotto degno.Lo consiglieresti? A molte delle persone che conosco si! Telefono completo e per chi non ha un uso intenso si porta a casa un esperienza davvero goduriosa, un piccolo Pixel senza grandi compromessi, in più il designe mi ha colpito molto, davvero bello almeno a mio avviso.","Reviewed in Italy on 12 February 2024","3.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Io ho acquistato Pixel 7A a dicembre 2023, era in offerta a 399€ ed era dato con Android 13 che si é subito aggiornato al 14.Pregi:Parlare dei pregi di questo smartphone é facilissimo. E' super fluido, ha un'ottima risoluzione e ha un display che mi ha colpito al primo sguardo (e io vengo da iphone con display OLED). Ottima la gamma dinamica 60-09Hz vi garantisco che si vede e l'apprezzo tanto ma davvero tanto ad ogni animazione (mia moglie no... ma lasciamo stare).Perchè PixelDal mio punto di vista tutte le animazioni, la luminosità, le funzionalità di questo smartphone sono fatte davvero molto, ma molto, ma molto bene. Ottima l'illuminazione adattiva, i miglioramenti audio, tutto ciò che é stato fatto per Pixel é stato curato fin nel dettaglio più piccolo.BatteriaLa durata della batteria é ottima, non é grandissima ma davvero fai 24 ore di uso senza una ricarica, senza dubbio Google ha fatto un ottimo lavoro.Peso:Si sente il peso della bobina di ricarica wireless. A me piace, io ci vivo di ricarica wireless ma mia moglie avrebbe preferito uno smartphone più leggero ma senza questa funzione. Io abituato ad iPhone 13 lo sento leggero, lei abituata ad uno smartphone di 6 anni fa lo sente pesante.

Non sarà un camera phone ma penso che la maggior parte degli utenti non troverebbero differenza tra foto e video di questo pixel e 8a o un iPhone, soprattutto sul ""punta e scatta"" e l'uso social con questo smartphone non dovrete mai preoccuparvi di nulla, voi schiacciate il bottone e lui farà tutto il resto (compreso rimuovere i rumori come il traffico dai video).""Pixelate""L'editing post video che ti fa rimuovere oggetti e persone indesiderate dallo sfondo per me é fantascienza, comunque funziona abbastanza bene.Ora veniamo a dove Google si perde in un bicchiere d'acqua:- E se non voglio il meteo là in alto sulla home page? Non si toglie- E se la barra di ricerca la voglio in alto e non in basso? Non si sposta- E se voglio invertire il tasto indietro con il multi tasking (mia moglie non usa le gesture)? Non si puòInsomma, Google si perde su delle piccolezze in cui invece Samsung, Apple, Xiaomi sono andati molto oltre. Sicuramente ci sarà un modo per cambiare queste cosette ma devo sbattermici e non mi va, alla fine restano così ma sono piccole pecche che secondo me riflettono una certa pigrizia degli sviluppatori, non vedo come altro considerare queste mancanze (che ripeto, sono davvero banali).Confronti con mie esperienze precedenti:- Passaggio da Samsung a Pixel: E' come scendere dalla Fiat multipla e salire sulla Mercedes.- Rispetto a iPhone 13: Non ti fa sentire la mancanza di iPhone, se non fosse per l'ecosistema Apple...- Rispetto a Redmi11S: Se anche Xiaomi curasse il software in modo maniacale! peccato che non lo faccia.Come va nell'utilizzo quotidiano:E' compatto, non gli manca nulla, é super fluido in tutto e ha un display che é un piacere per gli occhi. Molto bene anche audio in chiamata e connessioni, sia telefonica che Wi-Fi alla grande. Bene l'audio dello smartphone in generale, molto buono il viva voce. Tutto gira molto bene anche il Bluetooth non sbaglia mai un colpo.Conclusioni:A mio parere a 399€ questo device ha un rapporto qualità/prezzo per cui é un vero Best Buy.PS: Questo smartphone non piace solo ad una persona, mia moglie. Lei voleva tenersi il suo vecchio, ma piccolo e leggero. Ma così compatto a questo prezzo c'è solo lui che va così bene, a meno che non passi alla mela piccola...  :(Spero di essere stato utile, buoni acquisti.","Reviewed in Spain on 11 May 2023","1.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Fünf Sterne wären jedoch ungerechtfertigt.","Andrea Pizzotti","Ich habe mir Pixel 7a als Nachfolgegerät für mein (verlorenes) iPhone 13 geholt. Als Hauptkaufgrund war zum einen der billigere Preis als iPhone und zum weiteren die guten Feedbacks in YouTube.Nach einer Woche Nutzung des Pixels stellte ich nun fest:Was mir gefallen haben-tolle Größe, mit 6,1 Zoll (wie iPhone) liegt es sehr gut in der Hand.-nach der Aktivierung von 90 Hz Bildwiederholrate ist es sehr flüssig-Kamera ist für ein knapp 500€ Smartphone absolut top.-drahtloses Laden ist schon fast ein Luxus-Feature.-Google-Dienste(benutze ich sehr oft im Alltag) wie Maps, Fotos, Google Authenfication etc. laufen auf dem Pixel ziemlich flüssig.-gefühlt ist das Netzsignale(5G) schneller als iPhone 13.Was mir nicht gefallen haben:-die Einrichtung war ein Tortur.-im Vergleich zu iPhone 13 ist der integrierte Lautsprecher ein Witz. Aber einigermaßen ausreichend. Dennoch Kopfhörer empfohlen.-nach dem Kauf wurde sofort Android 14 aktualisiert, damit hat Google-Sprachassistant völlig versagt. Es ist notwendig, Google-App manuell in Play Store zu aktualisieren. Danach geht es wieder, aber von Qualität her weit hinter Siri.-auch wenn Google selbe Prozessor in der A-Serie verbauen wie die teuere Versionen des Pixels, Spiel damit zu spielen verursacht Kopfschmerzen(call of duty). Setzt man die Grafik runter auf HD, immer noch schwindlig, erst bei mittel läuft das Spiel flüssig. Aber Spielerlebnis leidet zu sehr darunter.-Akku...oh Mann. Habe nie ein schlechteres Akku gesehen als dieses hier. Ladegerät immer mitnehmen. Oder holt man ein Mag-Hülle und ein Mag-Powerbank, dann kommt man wohl auch über den Tag.Fazit: trotz der aufgezählten Nachteilen muss man stets im Hinterkopf behalten, dass es sich um ein 489€ Mittelklasse-Smartphone handelt. Für den Pries bekommt man in dieser Klasse meiner Meinung nach kein besseres Smartphone. Wenn ihr nicht viel Wert auf UHD-Spiel legt und euch einen zusätzlichen Powerbank holt. Dann absolut Kaufempfehlung.","Reviewed in Italy on 22 August 2023","2.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"
"1730","Google-GHL1X-Unlocked-Smartphone-Charcoal","Dal 6a al 7a ..👇✍️","Bernardino Monticelli","Sono passato dal 6a, acquistato i primi giorni di agosto 2022 sempre qui su Amazon a questo 7a, preso dalla voglia di cambiare solo per sfizio visto che il 6a a distanza di 10 mesi dall'acquisto funzionava ancora meglio dei primi mesi ( hanno risolto il problemino dell'impronta con vetro temperato, la batteria adattiva si era pienamente assestata ai miei ritmi..)Ho speso 509 per il bundle con le Google buds A  ( che già avevo dal bundle per il 6a..) che sono delle ottime cuffie ma che regalerò a qualche mio familiare visto che già le possiedo e a distanza di una settimana posso iniziare a recensire questo 7a in paragone al 6a, che è stato il mio primo Pixel.Ebbene, se avete un 6a e pensate di passare al 7a, non fatelo, non c'è nulla che giustifichi realmente questo cambio, a meno che non sia per puro sfizio come per me.In aggiunta al 6A abbiamo:- refresh rate a 90hz (che è molto piacevole ma pur sempre una questione di sola abitudine)- un sensore fotocamera più potente da 64 megapixel contro i 12 del modello precedente che garantisce ottime foto, ma come già accade sul 6A seppur abbia un sensore Sony più datato- ricarica wireless a 7watt che è un aggiunta irrisoria visto che con tale wattaggio sarà una ricarica molto lenta, seppur sia comoda mentre la ricarica cablata è sempre a 18watt- nuovo processore Tensor G2 di fascia medio/alta, ma che di nuovo, nell'uso quotidiano per un utente medio non farà nessuna differenza rispetto al 6A, anche perché il vero elemento che spinge il telefono di Google è tutta la componente neurale che è stata progettata appositamente dall’azienda per spingere i suoi modelli tramite AI.-8gb di RAM anziché 6gb, ma anche qui la differenza si nota solo se li mettete sotto sforzo aprendo diverse app in contemporaneaLa Google experience è qualcosa di straordinario a mio avviso ed arrivando, prima del 6a,da un semplicissimo Xiaomi che aveva tremila app preinstallate ed un'interfaccia poco intuitiva per me il salto è stato enorme, e me ne ha fatto innamorare.E' senza dubbio uno smartphone di fascia media intuitivo, veloce, scattante, con la promessa di cinque anni di aggiornamenti ma soprattutto i Feature Drop, con i quali Google aggiunge funzionalità ai suoi telefoni mese dopo mese.Il vero problema è che ora è concorrenziale al 7 liscio, che offre uno schermo un po’ più grande ma soprattutto un sensore principale con diagonale maggiore, che costa pochissimo di più; e quindi qui la scelta è basata più che altro sulle dimensioni che sono più contenute su questo 7a.Ottima l'offerta con le Buds A, che costano singolarmente 100 euro mentre finita la promozione sarà da valutarne il prezzo finale.A mio avviso se starà intorno ai 450/430 euro sarà un best buy e lo consiglierei a prescindere.Per chi invece vuole risparmiare il 6A è comunque un dispositivo top da prendere ancora in considerazione visto che compie appena un anno ad Agosto 2023..Per chiudere la mia risposta è semplice, se volete passare dal 6a al 7a evitate e aspettate magari di prendere un futuro 8a, se invece volete cambiare il vostro smartphone magari arrivando da altri brand, cercate dimensioni più contenute e avete un budget di 450/500 euro andate diretti su questo, non ve ne pentirete.Ve lo dice uno che si è totalmente innamorato della fascia media dei Pixel che senza spendere una fortuna danno tutto ciò che serve ed anche di più.","Reviewed in Italy on 23 December 2023","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Im Vergleich zu den bisjährigen chinesischen Herstellern, hat Google Pixel 7a wirklich die Nase weit vorn, was die Ausstattung des Telefons betrifft und die Möglichkeiten, die man nutzen kann....für mich war eSim Karte und NFC Kaufrelevant und entscheidend, aber auch die Qualitat und Speicherplatz für Fotos..dieses habe ich noch nicht voll ausprobiert, aber das werde ich nachholen...Manko für mich: es gibt keine Möglichkeit die Kopfhörer mit Kabel einzustecken, wahrscheinlich, weil man heute mit den Kabellosen Kopfhörern mehr agiert. Das Telefon selbst ist deutlich kleiner als meine alten chinesischen. Aber das ist alles ok, bzw. noch jammern auf hohem Niveu...ich habe noch nicht alles ausprobiert, vor allem die Zahlfunktionen, danach werde ich mich erneut äußern.

Le recensioni le avete già viste. Gli unici punti critici a mio parere sono:- la batteria che poteva essere un po' più capiente per farti arrivare alle 22/23 anche in una giornata super stress, mentre in una giornata del genere alle 19/20 la batteria è gia al 20% se non meno.- Lo schermo che non mi ha entusiasmato, venivo da un amoled con colori stupendi e un bel contrasto netto e questo a confronto mi sembra un po' slavato (nonostante la luminosità ottima).- Con vetro protettivo il lettore impronte perde qualche colpo.Insomma qualche compromesso c'è, ma nel complesso lo consiglio, soprattutto per il prezzo accessibile, le ottime prestazioni, e l'ottima fotocamera che in questa fascia di prezzo fa la differenza.","Reviewed in Australia on 9 January 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Chi non ha avuto un Pixel e vuole avvicinarsi a questa esperienza, con questo Pixel 7a può farlo senza spendere un patrimonio: a 400 euro è un best buy.La batteria dura quanto deve senza lasciarti mai a piedi: un consiglio, abbiate pazienza per le prime 2 settimane, perché il Pixel imparerà dal vostro uso e la batteria migliorerà, andando ben oltre le 5 ore di schermo. Con la ricarica adattiva, poi, se lo lasciate in carica di notte ed avete impostato una sveglia, il Pixel si ricaricherà lentamente fino ad arrivare al 100% al vostro risveglio. Questo non usurerà la batteria ma, anzi, la ottimizzerà.Io che vengo da Pixel 6a  e poi da Pixel 7, ho preso questo 7a perché amo i ""piccoli"". E' una via di mezzo tra 6a e 7: display migliore del 6a perché 90hz e più luminosto, ma leggermente inferiore al 7 perché meno luminoso. Per il resto (esperienza d'uso, velocità, batteria e reparto fotografico) è esattamente come avere un pixel 7, a 200 euro in meno (io l'ho preso a 400 euro).Consigliatissimo.","Reviewed in Italy on 12 February 2024","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"
"1736","Google-GHL1X-Unlocked-Smartphone-Charcoal","20 anni avanti a tutti!","Luca Traverso","Ho preso il telefono durante il Black Friday a 450 euro con custodia inclusa. Pixel7a e Pixel sono praticamente identici in termini di funzioni, il pixel7 é un poco più grande ed ha il retro in vetro...mentre il Pixel7a ha il retro in plastica. Ho personalmente preferito scegliere un cellulare dalle dimensioni non esageratamente grandi e più resistente in caso di cadute, ho dunque scelto il Pixel7a.Ho ricevuto un telefono NUOVO, sigillato ed imballato con cura. Consegna velocissima.Collegando il cavetto tipoC in dotazione al vecchio cellulare, in una ventina di minuti il Pixel7a ha scaricato tutte le foto e per applicazioni, la rubrica ed anche le impostazioni!!!Attenzione: il cavetto in dotazione è tipoC da entrambi i lati (non ha USB) quindi dovrete acquistare un caricatore con ingresso tipoC oppure dotarvi di un cavetto USB/tipoC.Questo telefono ha delle funzioni assolutamente futuristiche: può tradurre diverse lingue straniere in diretta ed anche offline, può mettere i sottotitoli alle chiamate, con la fotocamera può tradurre testi stranieri (ad esempio il menù del ristorante). Consente l'utilizzo gratuito della VPN google1 che in caso di utilizzo di wifi pubblici assicura una maggiore sicurezza. Può monitorare la qualità del sonno, Ha android 14!!! Ha lo sblocco con impronta o face id. In più essendo google scarica gli aggiornamenti velocissimamente e android auto si collega in mezzo secondo.La batteria mi dura quasi 2 giorni e la ricarica è intelligente: il giorno carica velocemente,la notte lentamente prevedendo l'orario della sveglia.Le foto sono eccezionali!Che dire, mi sembra un prodotto eccellente da ogni punto di vista includo il prezzo e da quando ho preso questo telefono mi sembra di essere il protagonista di ritorno al futuro!!🤣🤣Unica pecca, non mi pare consenta il blocco con password delle applicazioni...che invece avrei di certo utilizzato.Personalmente poi mi infastidisce che il logo Google sia posizionato al centro del telefono (assieme alla bobina per la ricarica wireless) dove di solito si posiziona la placca metallica per il supporto auto magnetico. Devo scegliere se coprire il logo o passare a un supporto auto di diverso tipo.Ve lo consiglio sicuramente.","Reviewed in Italy on 14 March 2024","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Sì, magari non a 500€. Io l'ho preso al day one per avere le cuffie in omaggio che ho rivenduto immediatamente per 50€, portando il prezzo al di sotto di una mia soglia psicologica (non spendo mai più di 500€ per un telefono).Se lo trovate in sconto a 400/450 non pensateci due volte.

RECENSIONE SUPER ONESTA","thomas kantzilaris","Ho comprato questa cover per proteggere il mio iPhone 11 dall’acqua e dalla sabbia.Cover per escursioni, mare, etc: ASSOLUTAMENTE SI1) Qualità costruttiva ottima: solita e impermeabile. 5 stelle per il design2) La cover nonostante sia realizzata in plastica, non è scivolosa al tatto.3) L’installazione può richiedere un po’ di tempo (allineare il tasto silenzioso alla ghiera) ma tutto sommato non è così difficile (vi consiglio di guardare il video tutorial su youtube).4) La parte trasparente che copre lo schermo è in plastica e non in vetro: il feeling al tatto è diverso ma ciò non riduce affatto la sensibilità dei tocchi e il riconoscimento del face ID.5) Ha una fessura per legare un laccio alla cover (il laccio non è incluso nella confezione). Super utile per anti-taccheggio.Cover per uso quotidiano: ASSOLUTAMENTE NO.1) il volume è ridotto notevolmente a causa dell’isolamento.2) aprire e chiudere la porta lightning per caricare e attaccare le cuffie è fastidioso3) i tasti del volume e di spegnimento sono duri.4) Un iPhone 11 con questa cover diventa grande quanto un iPhone 11 Pro Max.5) Protegge dagli urti ma se viene danneggiata potrebbe non garantire più la sua impermeabilità. Non è un bumper.Se dovete andare al mare, in montagna e volete proteggere il vostro iPhone da acqua,pioggia, polvere e sabbia allora questa cover è quella che fa per voi.

And the screen has a cloud across it from the case no longer being as closely formed as it was to start. This is probably from the heat of the battery so not really a life proof issue but I’ve had otter box and pelican cases that were better than this.Move forward another few months and the screen issue is worse and the camera lenses are pretty much useless at this point. Clouded over and blurry(with the case off it’s perfectly clear)The misshaped case has made the screen almost unreadable unless I’m pressing on the back of the case.I am a fan of full coverage cases and life proof has done well for me in the past but this case is garbage at this point.You’d think that for the price you pay it would have better materials and last longer. It’s a wearable item I know but at this price point you’d think it would be a better product. Unfortunately lifeproof’s claimed warranty is not helpful. They claim it’s the phone’s fault not theirs and wash their hands of it.I long for the pelican cases back with their build quality and their true warranty.I would not recommend this case for anyone that charges their phone or actually lives a life outside of their bubble.Have a good day everyone","Reviewed in the United States on 3 December 2023","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"1979","LifeProof-FRĒ-Waterproof-Case-iPhone","Silent mode button notch is missing!","Marchetti Franco","I have always used life proof cases on my iPhones. So when I got my new iPhone 11 I immediately ordered a life proof case for the iPhone 11. I have been so exasperated for the last 20 minutes because every time I put the case on the phone it pushes that little button on the left side that turns your phone on silent mode. The older cases had a little notch that the button fit into so you could turn your phone silent by pressing the button back and forth. This case has some weird round knob where the old cases had that notch. Every time I put my iPhone in the life proof case it turned on the silent mode and there was no way to turn it off so I was getting no notifications. I had to keep taking the case off turning the silent mode off and trying to get the phone back into the case without turning it back into the silent mode. I finally got the phone in the case fingerprints and all that mess that you’re trying to avoid. Of course that notch always broke off so the the water proof aspect of the life proof case was void. I use the life proof case really to protect against breaking the phone when I drop it. Now the new iPhone 11 has waterproof features so you don’t really need that aspect of the life proof case. As far as protecting the phone from breakage when you drop it it’s an excellent case but this missing notch and not being able to turn the silent mode off is very exasperating! Now when you go into a meeting or you’re in church or somewhere that you don’t want your phone ringing you’ll have to actually turn the phone off or go under settings and turn the volume down instead of just pressing the silent mode button. What a hassle especially for the price of this case.","Reviewed in Italy on 19 May 2020","3.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"2012","Samsung-Galaxy-Buds2-Pro-Graphite",NA,"John Carlo","I am up to my second pair after returning my first pair due to one of the earphones ear detection failing in one ear (this meant that ANC, pass through and the touch controls on that earphone stopped working). My current pair now has this horrific mic feedback screaching noise in the left earphone that happens whenever you have ANC or passthrough on. The most infuriating part is that this has happened over the course of 2 months with the first pair lasting less then 2 weeks, and the second lasting about a month and a half, and this is compared to my Buds+ (an earlier model) that have lasted over 4 years.

Per i giochi stessa cosa molto performante anche sui giochi più pesanti come Cod Mobile, Genshin Impact e Fortnite.Su Fortnite si riescono a fare circa 50-60 fps, ottimo!I materiali sono molto buoni e resistendi, sopratutto il display che ora ne parliamo meglio.Il display e un gorilla glass 2 ed è un superamoled con molti colori vividi e con ben 120hz.Il peso del telefono forse è uno dei pochi difetti, infatti pesa ben 200g.Fotocamera anteriore da 48mp e anteriore da 13mp ed escono molto nitide sia quella frontale e anteriore.Abbiamo una batteria da ben 5000mAh infatti la durata della batteria è ottima e anche se la ricarica rapida samsung è di solo 25w si ricarica abbastanza velocemente.Un punto aggiuntivo per questo cellulare è la resistenza IP 67 (resistenza ad acqua e polvere).Il processore è un Mediatek dimensity 1080, processore veramente ottimo che riesce a gestire abbastanza bene anche il multitasking, ha anche il 5G.Consiglio vivamente questo telefono sulle 250-280 euro.

Doch ich wurde eines besseren belehrt !Das übertragen der Daten von ihrem s20fe Ging ohne Probleme (wie auch immer schon bei Android Smartphones 😉, ja ich hasse Apple Produkte seit meinem Fiasko des iPhone 6c 😉) .Das A34 5g macht seinem Namen alle Ehre. Das Smartphone hat einen Akku von 5000 mAh und ist somit , vom Akku her gesehen, schon besser als alle anderen Smartphones aus dem Hause Samsung die die Bezeichnung ""S"" beinhaltet, wohl gemerkt in der normalen Version und nicht in der ultra gold Extreme Pro Ultra Plus Edition 😂. Ebenso bietet das A 34 5g einen Speicher von 128gb was vielleicht nicht viel klingen mag, jedoch kann man den Speicher mit einer Micro SD Karte auf bis zu 1 Terabyte erweitern was ich genial finde da das das s20fe zb gar nicht kann oder andere Samsung Smartphones ebenso nicht. Das Display ist genial und bietet dank der 120hz ein geniales, flüssiges und sehr farbintensives Bild. Ebenso der Ton bzw die Lautsprecher des a34 5g ist genial da der Klang echt sehr gut ist. Da werde ich mit meinem Xiaomi 12X echt neidisch 😅. Der Akku lädt, mit dem richtigen Adapter , sehr schnell auf und selbst bei intensiver Nutzung merkt man das dem Akku nicht sehr an, ich spreche wohl gemerkt von whats App, Facebook und Instagram , eben solche Apps und keine Games denn wie wir wissen verbrauchen Games viel mehr Akkukapazität, jedoch selbst dort hält der Akku sehr lange stand.Kurz gesagt für den Preis und die Leistung die man erhält, würde ich, wie auch schon vor ein paar Jahren, ein Samsung der A Reihe definitiv einem der S Reihe vorziehen da die S Reihen Smartphones von Samsung mehr dazu dienen um mit Apple zu konkurrieren und sich denen gleich zu stellen anstatt ein gutes Preis Leistungsverhältnis zu schaffen , (Beispiel s23 ultra plus Kostenpunkt zwischen 1200 und 1400 Euro, niemals so viel Geld für ein Smartphone) .Was ich noch erwähnen muss, man bekommt zwar ein Ladekabel mitgeliefert was an beiden Enden einen USB C Anschluss hat, jedoch fehlt der dementsprechende Ladeadapter da würde ich zu einem mit mind 20 bis 40 Watt raten da dadurch das Aufladen wesentlich schneller und besser geht 🤫😉🤗.Ich hoffe ich konnte euch mit meiner Rezension etwas helfen 🤗.","Reviewed in Germany on 28 December 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Tomsche","Regalo che ho fatto a mia madre.Consegna ottima, arrivato addirittura in anticipo e senza neanche un graffio sulla scatola.Il cellulare è super veloce e non dà nessun tipo di problema. I colori sono vivaci e ben definiti. La schermata di blocco, invece, ha una voce aggiuntiva come “lo sblocco facciale”, comodissimo a mio avviso (tipo come l’iPhone), e anche questo è super attendibile, nel senso che appena accendi lo schermo si sblocca riconoscendo velocemente il viso. Per quanto riguarda la fotocamera, dotata di 48 MP, fa il suo lavoro più che dignitosamente, predispone anche del grandangolo e di uno zoom ben definito.Unica pecca la batteria, praticamente si scarica in meno di un giorno, anche senza un uso intenso. Ho letto altre recensioni dove affermavano il contrario, non capisco come. Mia madre usa solo Facebook, un giochino di pochi MB e ha quasi sempre, come unica cosa, il router acceso, al quale è collegato il tv per guardare film, ma non è questo ovviamente a far scaricare il cellulare, perché anche con il vecchio (J4) che aveva, faceva le stessissime cose ma con la differenza che la batteria le durava quasi 2 giorni, ottimo direi.Comunque le differenze, per lei, tra il vecchio (come già citato prima, J4) e il nuovo cellulare si notano tantissimo, quindi si può tranquillamente sorvolare sul fatto della batteria.La stella che manca ovviamente si riferisce alla batteria.Ps: la foto che vedete dello schermo è solo la pellicola che è stata messa male 😂","Reviewed in Italy on 4 January 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Così non serve a nulla, perchè costringe l'utente a comprare comunque un caricatore compatibile.

Con un display impressionante, un solido comparto fotografico e la connettività 5G, questo smartphone si presenta come una scelta eccellente per chi cerca un dispositivo di fascia media che non faccia compromessi.Il punto forte di questo smartphone è sicuramente il display FHD+ Super AMOLED da 6.6 pollici. I colori sono vibranti e ricchi di dettagli, con neri profondi e contrasti elevati tipici della tecnologia AMOLED. La risoluzione è più che sufficiente per la maggior parte delle attività, dalla navigazione web alla visione di contenuti multimediali.Le prestazioni sono garantite dal processore (specifiche non fornite nella richiesta) e dai 6 GB di RAM, che consentono di gestire agevolmente più app contemporaneamente e di eseguire giochi e applicazioni impegnative senza intoppi. Anche le operazioni di multitasking sono fluide, contribuendo a un'esperienza utente complessivamente piacevole.Per quanto riguarda la fotografia, il Galaxy A34 5G si difende bene grazie al sistema di fotocamere posteriori. Anche se non raggiunge le prestazioni di dispositivi di fascia alta, le foto sono dettagliate e ben bilanciate in termini di colori. La presenza di diverse modalità e funzioni, come la modalità notturna e la registrazione video in 4K, aggiunge versatilità alla fotocamera.La batteria offre una durata soddisfacente grazie alla capacità (specifiche non fornite nella richiesta) e all'ottimizzazione energetica del sistema. Anche con un uso intenso, è probabile che il telefono arrivi a fine giornata senza problemi. Inoltre, la ricarica rapida consente di tornare operativi rapidamente quando la batteria è scarica.L'integrazione della connettività 5G è un grande vantaggio per questo dispositivo. Ciò significa velocità di download e upload più rapide, nonché prestazioni più stabili in aree coperte da reti 5G. Questo rende il Galaxy A34 5G più ""future-proof"" e pronto per sfruttare al meglio le reti di nuova generazione.Un aspetto da tenere presente è il design. Sebbene sia soggettivo, il Galaxy A34 5G presenta un design elegante e moderno, con una parte posteriore curva e una disposizione delle fotocamere pulita. L'ergonomia è buona e il telefono è piacevole da tenere in mano.In sintesi, il Samsung Galaxy A34 5G è un eccellente smartphone di fascia media che offre una combinazione equilibrata di prestazioni, display di qualità e connettività avanzata. Se sei alla ricerca di un dispositivo che offra molte delle funzionalità dei flagship senza dover spendere una fortuna, questo modello merita sicuramente la tua attenzione.","Reviewed in Italy on 27 August 2023","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Was pleasantly surprised by the prompt delivery from Amazon UK to Australia - just eight days from the date of order. After unpacking I thoroughly investigated the product trying to find any evidence of fake, found none. The only detail which freaked me out a little was the country of origin - China, whereas the advertising image showed Korea. But given the variety of models sold under this single Amazon lot and the long period this item has been on the market I forgive the seller (as long as it works).The most difficult part of installing the drive was to unscrew the screw on the NVMe slot in my laptop (I had to use pliers instead of a screw driver...).

"2173","Samsung-Internal-Solid-State-Drive",NA,"Rich","As of this review, this is one of the two fastest SSD drives available to the consumer.Whether you need this speed is only something you can decide, but with real world (self tested) read speeds of ~6500 MB/s (megabytes per second, not megabits) and ~4800MB/s write, the numbers speak for themselves.To take full advantage of this drive, you will need a PCI-E 4.0 compatible motherboard which at this time only includes the newest AMD chipsets (B550 and X570). Intel is set to support PCI-E 4.0 on their next CPU/Mobo series Rocket Lake which is coming out in April.One final thing, at maximum speeds the drive gets very hot and will thermal throttle after transfering for above 5 or so minutes.

Called Samsung about it and they are just terrible. Basically just said I should have looked up the instructions and read the fine print before purchase, I asked to be escalated, they took all my details for a callback then ghosted me.They really need to be transparent about this as ssd’s can be moved around for various devices and not all can accommodate the heat sink while some need one and other manufacturers allow you to remove theirs.Buyer beware, hope you never need to use Samsung support","Reviewed in Australia on 22 June 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

I chalked it up to the read speed of the HDD so thought nothing of it but at 6-7tb full it REALLY slowed down to around 20mb/s read. Still thought it was the HDD so after copying all 7tb of data I tried accessing files on it and the folders took no joke 30 seconds to load it let along the file previews. Did a few speed tests and it was as the images above show like 4-10mb/s read/write. Swapped out the USD-C cable with another and it improved the speed to around 20-40mb/s but that’s it. Mind you this thing is rated for 450mb/s. Did all the diagnostic tools Samsung provides and basically it’s just a slow piece of crap after 6tb of storage used.Avoid the 8tb version.

"2237","Samsung-MU-PC1T0R-WW-Aluminium-Portable",NA,"Sandgroper","Arrived ultra quick from the UK to Australia, packaging intact. This thing is BLAZING fast. Still can't quite get over how quick it transfers. Bought as an external video editing drive for a new M1 Macbook and it does that beautifully, streaming 4k footage from it into Premiere Pro works amazingly well, might even be overkill where a T5 would have sufficed. Will transfer 5GB in like 6 seconds and anything under a gig feels like you're just transferring it between folders on an internal drive. It's also about the length and width of an ATM card and about 6 ATM cards thick. I love it!

Keeping in mind that PS4 games can't take advantage of the PS5's dedicated I/O hardware, it seemed to load the same save in roughly the same amount of time.

These gloves fit ""like a glove""  - they are the perfect length for my small hands, and the touch screen fingers work better than any other glove I've tried.  HOWEVER, and this is a big deal, the opening for the wrist is so small and has zero stretch, so I can barely get them on at all.  I have to wiggle them over the widest part of my hand and can barely get them on. Once on they are great, so I'm keeping them for now, but I don't know how long I'll be able to deal with that difficulty of getting them on/off.

Tout fonctionne bien, mais sans éclats. La finition est… Moyenne : les plastiques sont moyennement agréables, les boutons moyens, l'écran moyen… Au niveau technique, nous ne sommes clairement pas sur les dernières innovations, c'est sinon long pour obtenir les fonctions, du moins pas ultra-rapide, tout comme le slide. Les périphériques (caméras, son, micro...) sont moyens. Pour autant, pour le prix contenu (possibilité de règlement en quatre fois ultra-rapide et efficace), ce smartphone Samsung A14 fait bien le job. Donc un smartphone moyen d'un rapport qualité/prix correct pour qui ne recherche pas les toutes dernières innovations. Ce smartphone Samsung A14 est un produit cohérent par rapport à sa cible.

"2346","Samsung-Galaxy-A14-Black-Carriers","One of the Best Budget Phone to Date.","Rohan MacDonald","If your looking for the best budget phone that does what you need, you have come to the right place! This phone is very cheap considering the prices of other phones, It has a 60hz display that doesn't look awful, contains most features any other more expensive samsung phone would have, has a decent battery life (can last a day or 2 depending on how power intensive the apps you use are) and a decent camera with stabilisation for this price range (the camera is decent enough that I use it to record my youtube videos and they come out fairly good). The only drawbacks with this phone which may be bad depending on what you need the phone to do is that there is no NFC (contactless) on the phone meaning you can't pay contactless or use wireless charging and the fact that the phone DOES NOT come with a charging adapter but rather only a charging cable with USB-C at either end meaning you may need to buy a USB-C adapter separately or use a different cable with USB at one end and USB-C at the other end connected to a USB adapter just to plug it in to the wall. Other than that the phone has worked wonders for me! I Would certainly rate it one of the best budget phones out there currently! It is so good that I wrote this review using this phone.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 17 January 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

It's fast (mid range new exynos), has a great camera (and software to support it), good battery life, 25w charging (not the fastest but better than nothing), nice vibrant amoled screen, a bargain at around £305.Can confirm however that this is not the german version, I received a czech version like some other reviewers, with an 02 splash screen whenever it boots up from being turned off. However the 3 network does work fully and I have done calls on it so it is unlocked (and can accept other networks than 02). After picking english as the language however, there is basically no difference, other than the silly boot up screen.

One thing is the seal was broken, but I'm assuming it was a risky purchase anyway and because of the price I got for a retail standard of 500 euro, it was quite the steal. It also came with a lot of pre-downloaded bloatware apps, but it was simple to uninstall them. Sleek design. It doesn't come with a case so I bought a case and screencover for it. It only comes with a USB charger without a plug, so be sure to purchase that as well. I bought the phone for many reasons, namely after reading reviews about a 40 hour battery life, but it definitely only has 10 hours max, maybe 12 with minimal usage but it is a quick charge, so I don't mind. The camera is exceptional, and comes with varying levels of zoom and quality. It has an extra sd port of up to 1tb, so i bought a microsd of 1tb for 20 quid on amazon, so storage isn't an issue. Overall very happy with the phone, but it's still early days and I do feel a bit anxious about how there's no warranty on the phone.

Sus materiales son de mucha calidad y su pantalla es fantástica, con buenos colores y buen brillo. Va bastante fluido con una pantalla de 120hz y lo mueve todo a buena velocidad salvo algunas excepciones. Me ha decepcionado un poco la camara. Esperaba mucho de este móvil en el aspecto fotográfico y me ha fallado. Satura mucho los colores y a veces no enfoca bien al sujeto de la fotografía lo que puede ocasionar fotos borrosas. Cuando hay un leve movimiento ya sale borrosa no hay mucha estabilización. Los modos de cámara son complejos y no se termina de entender como sacar más partido. Supuestamente antes de la actualización 6.0 la camara era mejor, pero tras esta es prácticamente una camara de gama baja. Me estoy planteando incluso si me quedaré con el o no.

"2474","Samsung-A145R-Galaxy-64GB-Green","Soo slow! And the speaker doesn't really work either.","paolo","I bought it because my phone broke but I didn't want to spend a fortune. This phone takes absolutely rubbish pictures, the processor is slow so if I try and watch videos on Facebook, install or tiktok it's all crackly and picture and voice is never at the same pace. Also unfortunately when using the speaker it sounds like the phone is under water. A shame but it wasn't possible to return it and I use my phone less than before so that's a bonus lol.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 30 January 2024","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"
