    Review:As someone who spends a lot of time on their feet, I'm always on the lookout for comfortable slippers that provide both support and breathability. The RockDove Men's Original Two-Tone Memory Foam Slippers have exceeded my expectations in every way.Comfort:From the moment I slipped my feet into these slippers, I was enveloped in a cloud of plush memory foam. The contoured design molds perfectly to the shape of my feet, providing exceptional arch support and cushioning. I can walk around in these slippers for hours without any discomfort.Breathability:Despite their cozy warmth, these slippers don't make my feet feel sweaty or claustrophobic. The special design fabric allows my feet to breathe freely, even on warm summer nights. This is a game-changer for someone who tends to overheat in traditional slippers.Style:I've never thought of slippers as being particularly stylish, but the RockDove Men's Original Two-Tone Memory Foam Slippers are a different story. The sleek design and elegant two-tone color scheme make them look more like casual loafers than slippers. I feel confident wearing them around the house or even running errands in them.Overall:These slippers are an absolute must-have for anyone looking for comfortable, supportive, and stylish footwear. The memory foam provides unmatched comfort, the breathable fabric keeps feet cool, and the stylish design makes them suitable for both indoor and outdoor wear. I highly recommend these slippers to anyone seeking a combination of comfort, practicality, and style.Pros:* Exceptional arch support and cushioning* Breathable fabric for all-day comfort* Stylish design for both indoor and outdoor wear* Durable construction for long-lasting wearCons:* None that I can find

    These are really nice when you first put them on, but the memory foam didn't have a very long memory I guess. After a the first weekend they'll be fairly flat. Looking at my order histor though I buy these every 2 years more or less exactly, so in the long run they must be decent right?They're pretty warm, but not too warm in summer. They hold up fairly well (other than the memory foam) and they do mould to your feet quickly. I should probably be replacing them annually really, but this time I picked up 2 pairs at once so I can try that.Overall I think they're reasonably priced and fairly hard wearing, for the odd trip outside they're great. Just beware the memory foam doesn't last long.

    I recently purchased the RockDove Foam Slippers, and I couldn't be happier to have done so. These slippers have completely exceeded my expectations in terms of comfort and general wearability.On first slip on, the memory foam in these slippers is a game-changer. It feels like I'm walking on a cloud with every step I take. The cushioning is so plush and supportive that I find myself wearing these slippers not only around the house but also when I step outside to grab the mail or take out the trash. They really have helped with some of the plantar fasciitis that I've been dealing with. And since they are plush, but also pretty breathable, I wear them often even when it is a warm day.Another feature I appreciate is the easy on-and-off design. The backless style means I can slide my feet in and out effortlessly, which is super convenient. I have another pair of slippers that I just don't use because they are less slip on and more like putting on a shoe. And even with the low back, the slippers don't just fall off your feet.In terms of sizing, I found that they fit true to size, and the size chart provided by RockDove was accurate. I have size 15 feet and these fit without complaints out of the box.These are some great slippers and I do recommend them. They feel good and they don't look lame like some house slippers do. Great buy!

    I work at home, so I spend most of the day with them. Almost two months of intensive use and they are still perfect. Very sturdy, comfortable, very nice, they protect well when you hit a corner of the wall or furniture :)...I highly recommend.

    When these first arrived they were so comfortable I didn't really want to take them off. They looked smart, were lightweight and had a good footbed and sole. A solid 5 star review was on the cards.However, the more I wore them the more the memory foam forgot that it was supposed to recover and the flatter the footbed became. This meant that not only did they become less comfortable but you could feel any and every lump or gap you trod on, and they became harder to keep on one's foot. Finally they started slipping off when going up or down stairs and creating their own slip hazard - eventually causing me to fall (luckily) when going up the stairs.I really wanted to like these, but in the end I returned them, and am now looking for a replacement.CUSTOMER SERVICE: Worth 5 StarsI must add a note about their customer services. After I had returned these (and received a refund) I got a message from Rock Dove apologising that I had had problems with their slippers and offering to refund the purchase price. Although I turned down the offer I was impressed enough to see that they obviously monitor feedback, and have now ordered a different pair.

    These shoes were tight on the first day. On the second day, the shoes were adjusted naturally, as stated in the instructions that arrived with the shoes. Now the fit is perfect, comfortable, and the color is perfect. Planning on ordering another pair to use in my RV. Great product!

    I gave a pair of these slippers to my husband for Christmas.His feet are slightly different sizes, with his left foot more or less fitting into a size 12 shoe while his right foot needs a size 13. Buying shoes or slippers has always been a frustrating trial for him.First off, these slippers come in larger sizes; so that was a homerun right off the bat.Still, I was uncertain what size to buy;so I measured the length of a pair of his shoes, compared that length to the given length of the slippers, and then bought the corresponding size, 13-14 US. I was afraid they might be too big, but thought ""better a bit too big than too small"".Well, he reports that the 13-14 fits him perfectly, and is wearing them daily. He no longer pads around the house in his socks.He likes that these slippers are easy to slip on and off, yet stay on his feet while he's walking.He likes that he can wear them with either thin or thick socks.He likes that, because of their thick, waterproof soles, he can step outside in them and his feet and socks will remain clean and dry, even if it has been raining or there is a bit of snow on the ground.What I like is that these slippers are attractive. He had bought himself a couple of pairs of what you might call ""typical"" men's slip-on slippers that were brown, more open and very thin soled. Apparently, they were the only things he could find, a few years back, that would fit his feet. They had gotten pretty ratty-looking, and a pair of ratty-looking size 12 slippers is not something that I enjoyed seeing lying about the house. So I admit that I was not seeking comfort in a slipper for him, but a higher esthetic. Happily, we can break out the party favors because these slippers have fulfilled both needs.These two-toned blue and Grey slippers are, so far, holding their shape. After two weeks of wear, they still look new. And, if a size 13-14 man's shoe can be ""cute"" these are. Seeing them in the front hall (where he leaves them when he goes out) bothers me not a whit.In short, these slippers are five star: warm, comfortable, useful, sturdy, attractive, and a perfect fit. My husband says this was the best present he's received in years.As he is a tough sell on most things, this is high praise. Warms the heart that I did something nice for the aging relative. I am, after all, quite fond of him.

    I usually take a size 7 and these size 7 fit well. Very cushioned sole for comfort. The material is fluffy on the outsize but fleecey on the inside so extremely warm. The high back means they don't fall off easily. Rubber sole fro grip means I am not constantly nearly launching myself down the stairs each time I go up or down! Good value for money.

    I was pleased to find 1/2 sizes and Ordered my standard 4 1/2 with the confidence they would fit perfectly but they are too big and are also a wide fitting which isn‚Äôt mentioned at all in the description. The sole isn‚Äôt as wide as the fabric of the slipper so that overhangs and sits on the floor, so i imagine will quickly wear. The back is not high enough to reach the part of your heel that holds the thing onto your foot, so it slops off when you walk and i suspect would do so even if they fit well. My existing slippers only have half a sole left, so are slightly more dangerous than these, so I'm keeping these to wear until I can go buy some that fit. I‚Äôm also not paying ¬£4 plus to send them back when in my opinion the sizing isn‚Äôt accurate, plus, they should have been advertised as wide fitting which would have meant I wouldn‚Äôt have entertained them in the first place. In the interest of fairness i can say that the inside memory foam is soft and comfortable and the stitching is a reasonable quality.

    I thought these slippers were a bit expensive, but money well spent! I have arthritis in my feet and most slippers either don‚Äôt give enough support or the soles are too stiff which makes my feet ache‚Ä¶ these are perfect!  Soft and comfortable, memory foam inside and plenty of arch support, but really warm and cosy too. The purple ones also look great (not at all ‚Äòold people slippers‚Äô!), so well worth the money in my view.

    I live in a 100 year old home in the Midwest and the floors get COLD!  I do not like slippers since I find them cumbersome but our recent cold snap has changed my mind!These slippers are light but very sturdy.  They are easy to slip into and stay securely on my feet.  I have a house with stairs everywhere and I was concerned that the memory foam might be too thick and make slippers difficult to walk in but that is not the case.  The rubber sole is nice and secure on hardwood floors.  I was also concerned that the ""fuzzy"" outside of the slippers would pickup lint and anything that was on the floor and they don't.Another nice thing is that each slipper has a small logo on the outside so you can tell which foot is which!I have not tried washing yet but these slippers seem very well made so I don't anticipate an issue.I will definitely purchase again!

    These are nice warm slippers, made from all natural materials to allow your feet to breathe.The lining is wool- it is not sheep skin which I had expected as the title is ""Nordvek Mens Genuine Suede Sheepskin Wool Lined""- the suede is from a sheep- hence the sheepskin, it is not a sheepskin lining like that in Ugg boots etc.Having set that straight the slippers themselves are good quality, they have no sole, it is a slipper that is in two pieces, the foot glove and the top which is stitched in, so it is all suede and can not be worn outside the house ( no popping out to put something into the bin in these).The fit is true to size and they stay on the foot instead of your foot slipping around in them and the slipper coming off, this means that they are fine to wear going up and down stairs.The suede is nice and soft and these slippers are very comfortable and will no doubt soften even more with wear making them better still.

    I normally go for 9 1/2 so ordered size 10. Initially the fit seemed rather narrow but the nature of the material proved pretty stretchy and the fit became comfortable in a very short time. I think that size 11 would be a little loose fitting for me.  Quality of finish seems very good and service from this seller and the prompt delivery of the item can be commended

    I have been looking for suede slippers without soles for many years, so I am very pleased I have now found a supplier, thank you. I have found them to be well made and very comfortable. I took other reveiws recommendations to buy a size larger and found the slippers to fit snugly.Overall I am very pleased with the slippers with one comment that the labels fitted to the underside were extremely difficult to remove, so maybe labelling should be done differently.

    Although happy with this product as to fit and comfort we were very upset to discover that, after one evenings wear only, the navy dye from the slippers leached out strongly into our pale beige carpet. It took considerable treatment to remove this dye and the cleaning treatment( using a well known carpet cleaner) has leached colour out of the carpet and basically ruined a brand new ¬£900 carpet only laid 3 weeks previously. What adds to the distress is that there was no warning on the packaging or invoice that dark colours might bleed out. We shall be contacting the manufacturers about this issue. Additional: Have had very decent feedback from the company 'Maddog retail Ltd'. who have apologised and refunded cost and offered funds towards cleaning the carpet. There was no colour bleed warning, as this problem has not happened before.

    These slippers are ideal for me because I needed some with a non rubber sole because my wife and daughter are allergic to rubber. These slippers filled the requirement, fitted perfectly and are comfortable with a fleece lining which keeps the feet warm and snug. They have laces which can be used to adjust the fit slightly although I find they come undone every so often but my previous similar slippers also did this, not a big problem but something to be aware of. All in all I highly recommend these slippers.

    many comments about needing a size bigger ,i think thats simply because the furry lining makes them feel like a tight fit, but the pile flattens down down so my advice is buy your normal size!Warm soft and quiet on hard floors- exactly what I wanted !

    I use these as house slippers and they were bought to replace a pair purchased from a large chain store for $25, but the chain store no longer carries them.  Prices on similar product can run into the hundreds of dollars so $35 is a good price.  I bought size 12 UK (13 US) and that is what I received.  They fit very tight initially, as expected, but loosened up within a couple days and are now perfect, which is what any leather moccasin or slipper will do.  The lining is fine and has held up well so far.

    These are nice warm slippers, made from all natural materials to allow your feet to breathe.The lining is wool- it is not sheep skin which I had expected as the title is ""Nordvek Mens Genuine Suede Sheepskin Wool Lined""- the suede is from a sheep- hence the sheepskin, it is not a sheepskin lining like that in Ugg boots etc.Having set that straight the slippers themselves are good quality, they have no sole, it is a slipper that is in two pieces, the foot glove and the top which is stitched in, so it is all suede and can not be worn outside the house ( no popping out to put something into the bin in these).The fit is true to size and they stay on the foot instead of your foot slipping around in them and the slipper coming off, this means that they are fine to wear going up and down stairs.The suede is nice and soft and these slippers are very comfortable and will no doubt soften even more with wear making them better still.

    My son is the fussiest with shoes and trainers.He has trainers and wears them out until he has to have a new pair. However he likes these. It‚Äôs actually nice to see him in a non black pair of trainers.He is particularly fussy about the width narrowness if new trainers and takes an age to get a new pair every time.This pair have are comfortable in the width, are not cut too high on the ankle.He had the slate grey with black stripe and white rubber trim around the bottom sole.

    I bought these as a punt. I saw the price and knew that it would be very difficult to find a proper running shoe for under ¬£100 / $150 (actually for running). The inner cushioning is okay 7/10. Not as good as my actual running shoes made by Puma. The outer is much stiffer 6/10. So, what are you buying these for? If you want running shoes, buy an actual pair of good high technology running shoes, and expect to pay 3 times this easily. You wont injure yourself with good proper runners gear. Your knees wont hurt as much from every impact, and you will be less likely to get shin splints. You will be more likely to actually get fit, because you won't stop from daily aches and occasional hard impact injuries. But ... If you want comfortable shoes for daily urban walks, these are fantastic. The price is amazing for just comfortable daily non-running workouts.

Their sleek design and comfortable fit immediately caught his attention, and he's been thoroughly impressed with their performance during his runs. The shoes offer reliable support and cushioning, providing the comfort needed for longer distances. The durability of the materials used is noteworthy, holding up well to the wear and tear of an active lifestyle.
